<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Since it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
