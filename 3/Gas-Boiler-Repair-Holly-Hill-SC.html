<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
