<p>Think about prospective impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heater.

A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
