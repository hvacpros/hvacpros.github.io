<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
