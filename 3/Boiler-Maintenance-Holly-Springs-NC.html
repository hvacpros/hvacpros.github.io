<h3>Home Furnace in Holly Springs NC</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
