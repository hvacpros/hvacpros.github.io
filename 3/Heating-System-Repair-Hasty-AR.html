<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
