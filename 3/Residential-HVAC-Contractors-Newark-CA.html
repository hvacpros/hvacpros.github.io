<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German technology". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to develop a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
