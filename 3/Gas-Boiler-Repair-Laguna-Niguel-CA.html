<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
