<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>

There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
