<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
