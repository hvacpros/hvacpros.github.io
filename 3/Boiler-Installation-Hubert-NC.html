<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents need to look out to the development of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps must not be undertaken until these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really handy in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>

He plainly and completely discussed all issues and fixes in a manner that made me positive in his capability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my partner and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout among the coldest winters in recent memory. He likewise reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to an issue that could not be dealt with on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
