<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The first ac system and refrigerators used flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
