<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Decatur AL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an a/c moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
