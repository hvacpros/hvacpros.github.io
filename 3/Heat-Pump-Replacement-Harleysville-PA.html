<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

Since the energy used to heat your home is drawn out straight from the ground, it protects the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or contaminants.

While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far less greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
