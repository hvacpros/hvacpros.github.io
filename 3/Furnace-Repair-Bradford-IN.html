<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
