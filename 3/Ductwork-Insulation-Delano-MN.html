<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, offices and schools matters, particularly given that we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity.
