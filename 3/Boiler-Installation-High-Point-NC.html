<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces in High Point NC</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
