<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode".

When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
