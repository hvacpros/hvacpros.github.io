<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
