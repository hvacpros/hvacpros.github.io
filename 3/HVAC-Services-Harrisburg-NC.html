Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
