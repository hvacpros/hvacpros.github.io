Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
