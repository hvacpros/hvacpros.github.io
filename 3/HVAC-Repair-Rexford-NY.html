<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Rexford NY Home Owners</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
