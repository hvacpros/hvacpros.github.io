<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
