<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
