<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
