With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey alternative, however more recent systems can be really energy efficient.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
