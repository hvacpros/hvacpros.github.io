<p>Generally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the producer's instructions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
