<p>Although installation is simple and doesn't need much time, attempting this job is not a great idea.

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
