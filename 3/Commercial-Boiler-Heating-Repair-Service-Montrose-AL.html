<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
