<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<p>Radiant heating systems do not utilize ducts, that makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They also don't create hot and cold areas. All of the heat that radiant heat systems disperse relocations through strong objects, keeping the heat near the flooring of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heating systems can also heat rooms with less energy invested, and keep them warmed for longer, since many floorings tend to retain heat better than air does.<p>
