<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
