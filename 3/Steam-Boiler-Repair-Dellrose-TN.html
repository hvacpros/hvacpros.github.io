Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your physician about them. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
