<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
