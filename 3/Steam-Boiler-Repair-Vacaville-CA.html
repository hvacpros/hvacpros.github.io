Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.

Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.
