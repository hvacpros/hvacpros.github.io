<p>There are two main types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are required to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
