<h3>Things to Look for When Selecting an Blauvelt NY HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
