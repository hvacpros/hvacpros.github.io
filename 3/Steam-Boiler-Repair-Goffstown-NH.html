In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
