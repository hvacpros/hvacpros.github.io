<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Malibu CA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
