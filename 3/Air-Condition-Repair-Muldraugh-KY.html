<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations.
