<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.

<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations.
