My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
