"Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
