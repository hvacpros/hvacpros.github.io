<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
