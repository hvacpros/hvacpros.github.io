<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day.

The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
