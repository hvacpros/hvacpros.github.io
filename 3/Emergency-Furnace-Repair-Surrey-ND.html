Subsequently, the most efficient method to minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>

Ares bought CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
