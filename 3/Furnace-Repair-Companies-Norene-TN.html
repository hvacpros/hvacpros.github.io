We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioner before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
