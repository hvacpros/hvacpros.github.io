<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
