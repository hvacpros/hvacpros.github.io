<h3>How to Select An Expert HVAC Technician in Salamonia IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
