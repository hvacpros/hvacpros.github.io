For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
