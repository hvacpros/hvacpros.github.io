<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
