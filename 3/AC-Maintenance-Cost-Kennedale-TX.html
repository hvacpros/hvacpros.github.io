<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heating system over a standard forced air heating unit. Radiant heat systems tend to be a lot more energy efficient than other heating units, for one thing. Forced air heater tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Forced air heating systems also tend to produce cold and hot spots throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>These concepts-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may already be altering.

A more energy efficient home will not only lower the cost of a new system and energy expenses, but it will greatly improve the convenience of your home. Prior to we style and set up any systems, we arrange a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these enhancements. Standard enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing procedures.
