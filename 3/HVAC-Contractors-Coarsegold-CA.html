In North America, split systems are usually seen in residential applications, but they are getting popularity in little commercial buildings. The split systems are a fantastic option for small buildings where ductwork is not possible or where the area conditioning effectiveness is of prime concern. 19 The advantages of ductless air conditioning systems include simple installation, no ductwork, higher zonal control, flexibility of control and quiet operation. citation required In area conditioning, the duct losses can account for 30% of energy consumption. 20 Using minisplit can result in energy cost savings in space conditioning as there are no losses related to ducting.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
