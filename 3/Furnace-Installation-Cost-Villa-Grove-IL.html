<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
