<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
