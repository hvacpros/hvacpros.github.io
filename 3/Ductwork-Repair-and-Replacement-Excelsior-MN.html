<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
