<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Free Union VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
