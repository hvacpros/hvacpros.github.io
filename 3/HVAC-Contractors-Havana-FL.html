<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Havana FL Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
