<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

It takes very little time to warm up or cool down the house which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had in the past. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day.

I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

<p>There is no simple answer, however numerous use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better option. If the present system has not incurred other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
