<h3>Heating Contractors in Thomaston GA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the quantity of heat you want produced. If the system is too small, then your home won't be heated properly and the system will need to continuously run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan does not. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you have actually offered it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
