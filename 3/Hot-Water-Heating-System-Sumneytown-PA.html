<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Sumneytown PA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really educated. Expenses are sensible. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
