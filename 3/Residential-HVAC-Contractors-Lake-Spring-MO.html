<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Old heaters often begin to make some unusual sounds as they get towards completion of their life. Have you heard any banging, popping, rattling, or screeching noises originating from your furnace?
