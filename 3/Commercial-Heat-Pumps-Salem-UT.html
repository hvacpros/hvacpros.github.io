<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
