<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
