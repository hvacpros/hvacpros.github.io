<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Dunnellon FL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<h3>Central Heating Repair in Dunnellon FL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
