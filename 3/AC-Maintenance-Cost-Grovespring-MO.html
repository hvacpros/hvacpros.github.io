He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
