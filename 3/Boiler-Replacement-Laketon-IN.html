<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a harmful build-up and jeopardize your safety if the exhaust outlets are clogged. The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will try to find indications of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
