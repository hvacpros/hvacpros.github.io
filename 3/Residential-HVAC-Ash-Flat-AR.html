<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
