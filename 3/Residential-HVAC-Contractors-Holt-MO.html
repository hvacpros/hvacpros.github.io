<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Holt MO</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. If your AC unit is frosty, the evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. Likewise, if the a/c smells bad, there could be bacteria buildup on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil takes in the heat far from your home. It will draw from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to replace the a/c unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will reduce benzene direct exposure consist of getting rid of cigarette smoking within the home, providing for optimum ventilation throughout painting, and disposing of paint materials and special fuels that will not be used instantly.<p>
