All the moist hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled.

One of the primary locations where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the specialists believed they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
