<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Camp AR</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
