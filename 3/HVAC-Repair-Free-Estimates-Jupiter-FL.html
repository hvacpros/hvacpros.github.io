<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, so many Seattleites need to find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens.

<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted.

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
