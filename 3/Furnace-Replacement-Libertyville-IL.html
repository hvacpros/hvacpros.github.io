<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
