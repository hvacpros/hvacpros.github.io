<p>For entire home installations, it's difficult, if almost difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be used in one or a number of rooms like bathrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric glowing flooring heat.
