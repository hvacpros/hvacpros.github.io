<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
