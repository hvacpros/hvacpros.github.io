<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Issues in Menlo Park CA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
