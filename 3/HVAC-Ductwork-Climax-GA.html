<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites must find methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays.

While an area heater is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
