Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate significant savings in annual heating costs.

I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
