<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an essential concern to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution studies have actually identified several contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>

<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
