<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy.

<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat.

Review of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
