Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
