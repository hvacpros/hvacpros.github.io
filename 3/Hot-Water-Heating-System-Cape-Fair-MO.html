<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Cape Fair MO HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
