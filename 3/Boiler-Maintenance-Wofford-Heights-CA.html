<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability.

Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
