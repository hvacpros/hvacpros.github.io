<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Hollis NH</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them..
