<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Solana Beach CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>

<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers at Solana Beach CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
