After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
