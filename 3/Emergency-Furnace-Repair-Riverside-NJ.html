<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
