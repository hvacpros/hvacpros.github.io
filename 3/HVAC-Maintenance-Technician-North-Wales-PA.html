<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in North Wales PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
