<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that gathers during summer seasons. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating unit burners are inspected and cleaned up completely before cooler seasons start. Always be sure that the furnace is tidied up yearly to prevent soot and condensation which triggers burners to quit working properly. If your furnace is in a very bad condition, perhaps it is time to start thinking of buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air conditioning system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than models made even 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your system if it's five years old or older.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
