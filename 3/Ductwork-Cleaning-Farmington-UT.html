<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Heating Contractors in Farmington UT</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
