<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Waycross GA</h3>
<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air unit. In reality, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our suggestion, anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to set up central air conditioning. In addition, cooling contractors may charge an extra $50 to $200 for additional supplies and equipment.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
