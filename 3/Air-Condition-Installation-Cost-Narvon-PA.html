Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal.
