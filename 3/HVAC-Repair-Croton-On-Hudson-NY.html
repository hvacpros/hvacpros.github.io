<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may discover musty or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse.

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
