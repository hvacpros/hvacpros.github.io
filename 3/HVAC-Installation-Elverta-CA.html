<h3>The Way to Pick An HVAC Company at Elverta CA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up inspection outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
