<p>The primary factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the quantity of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost may not be rewarding. Any significant repairs ought to be covered under the manufacturer's service warranty.

<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
