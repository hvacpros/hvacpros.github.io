<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
