<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
