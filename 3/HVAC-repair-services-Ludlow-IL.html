<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
