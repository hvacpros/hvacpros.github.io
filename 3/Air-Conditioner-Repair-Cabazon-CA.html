<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor.

<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat.
