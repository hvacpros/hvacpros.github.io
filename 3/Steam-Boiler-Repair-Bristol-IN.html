<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced ultimately. As equipment ages, it ends up being less effective. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its expected lifespan, replacement may be the most cost-efficient option.<p>

During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
