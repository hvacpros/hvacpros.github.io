<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Sean was really practical. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
