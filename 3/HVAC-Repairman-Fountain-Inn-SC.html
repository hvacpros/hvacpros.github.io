Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the problem.
