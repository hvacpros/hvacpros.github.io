<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
