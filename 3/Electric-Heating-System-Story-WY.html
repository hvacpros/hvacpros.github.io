<p>By clicking Confirm Consultation, you affirm you have actually read and agree to the HomeAdvisor Conditions & terms, and you concur and authorize HomeAdvisor and its affiliates, and their networks of Service Professionals, to provide marketing calls or texts utilizing automated technology to the number you supplied above regarding your project and other house services uses.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
