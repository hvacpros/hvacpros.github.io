<h3>Air Conditioning And Refrigeration in Ligonier IN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
