<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Quakertown PA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
