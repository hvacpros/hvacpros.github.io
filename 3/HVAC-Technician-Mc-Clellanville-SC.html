<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly costly to set up, particularly in an older house.

During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>These people have been fantastic. At a real estate agent, I in some cases need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Recently I needed to contact these people twice. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
