<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
