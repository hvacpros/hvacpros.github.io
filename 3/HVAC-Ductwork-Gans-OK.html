<p>You're motivating the development of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can likewise irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that perfect temperature all year round.

High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
