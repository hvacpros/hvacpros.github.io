<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to offer me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I needed to call on these men two times. They came out rapidly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work.

He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in current memory. He also reacted to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a momentary repair to a problem that could not be fixed on the first see due to not available parts.

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild impacts that are often mistaken for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, tiredness and nausea. The results of CO exposure can vary greatly from person to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
