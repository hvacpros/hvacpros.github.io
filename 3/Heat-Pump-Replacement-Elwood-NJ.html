Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been properly dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
