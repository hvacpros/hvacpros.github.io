<h3>Steam Boiler Repair in Woodbridge CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
