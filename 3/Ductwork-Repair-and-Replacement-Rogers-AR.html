Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
