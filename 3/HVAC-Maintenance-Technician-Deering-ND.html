<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>While pollutants frequently discovered in indoor air are accountable for lots of hazardous effects, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are needed to produce specific illness. People likewise react extremely differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research study is needed to better comprehend which health effects take place after direct exposure to the average toxin concentrations found in houses and which happen from the higher concentrations that occur for brief amount of times.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically vital to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking information from the employer. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative must request that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
