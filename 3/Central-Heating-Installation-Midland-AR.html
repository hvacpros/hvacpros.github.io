<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
