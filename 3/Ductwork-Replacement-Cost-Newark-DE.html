<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
