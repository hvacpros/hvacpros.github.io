<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the very same indoor air problems as single-family houses due to the fact that many of the contamination sources, such as the interior building materials, home furnishings, and family products, are similar.
