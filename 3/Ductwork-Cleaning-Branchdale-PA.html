<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow.

In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Most people prefer to change their furnace as a prepared house enhancement instead of a panic replacement when your furnace is failing or has already normal life-span of a warm air furnace will differ based upon its operating environment, that's why it is necessary to have the system serviced routinely by a certified technician. They will have the ability to appropriately assess the condition of the furnace and make any recommendations.<p>
