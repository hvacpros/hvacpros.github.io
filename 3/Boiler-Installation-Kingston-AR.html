<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to produce a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in automobiles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already commonly utilized in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide contracts.  The so called respectable companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits.

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
