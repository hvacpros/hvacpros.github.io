<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
