<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>When you and your household walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold during the winter or too warm in areas during the summer season? Whether you're having an issue with irregular cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific House & Convenience, Inc. has the services and items you need.<p>
<p>As soon as every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you should get your HVAC system visually checked at least. This evaluation is an essential aspect of HVAC maintenance.

Since you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is repaired, that's the last thing you want. Regular evaluation and maintenance also helps keep it in good shape and prolongs its life.<p>
