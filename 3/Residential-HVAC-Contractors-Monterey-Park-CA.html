<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and work environments matters, particularly because we invest most of our lives indoors. Ac system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
