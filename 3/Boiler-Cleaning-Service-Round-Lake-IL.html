They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My partner said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have met in a very long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us.
