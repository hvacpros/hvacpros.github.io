<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
