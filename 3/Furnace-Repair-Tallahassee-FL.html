<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with direct exposure to toxic substances from microorganisms that can grow in big building ventilation systems. Nevertheless, these diseases can likewise be traced to bacteria that grow in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, elderly individuals, and people with breathing issues, allergic reactions, and lung illness are particularly vulnerable to disease-causing biological representatives in the indoor air.<p>
