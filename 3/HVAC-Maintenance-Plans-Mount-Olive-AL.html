<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>

The 2 operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
