Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, smoking, family items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in produced products.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
