The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter season can intensify issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be knowledgeable about some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>If your single stage air conditioning unit isn't old adequate to validate replacement, consider an entire house dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and making it possible for greater convenience at greater temperatures.<p>
