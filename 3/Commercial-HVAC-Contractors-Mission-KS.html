<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the house. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it remains in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate results that are frequently incorrect for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, dizziness, queasiness, tiredness and disorientation. The results of CO exposure can differ greatly from person to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
