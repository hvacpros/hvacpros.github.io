<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
