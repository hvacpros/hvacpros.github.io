<p>Indoor environments are highly complicated and building residents may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the type of particles and gases) from office devices, cleaning items, building and construction home furnishings, carpets and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside pollutants.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
