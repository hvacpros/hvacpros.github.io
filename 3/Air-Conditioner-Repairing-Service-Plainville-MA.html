<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one action mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
