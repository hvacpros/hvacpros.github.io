They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
