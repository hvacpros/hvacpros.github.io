<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
