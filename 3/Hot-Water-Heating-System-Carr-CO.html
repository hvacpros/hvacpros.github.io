<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
