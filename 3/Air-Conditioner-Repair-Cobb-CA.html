<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
