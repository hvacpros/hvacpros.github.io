(See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners need to look out to the introduction of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out until these problems have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).
