<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will decrease the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose irritation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
