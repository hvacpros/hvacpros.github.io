<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, though, there will always be the odd issue that sometimes comes up. When you do see your furnace behaving oddly, it is really essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible. The faster you react to problems with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will only make the issue even worse, and frequently more costly.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older. The very best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the very same quantity of cooling.<p>

<p>Move the thermostat setting to heat." A furnace can be intimidating-- particularly when the heat will not switch on. However, there is great news from furnace repair pros. Roughly a quarter of all service calls might be prevented with simple furnace repairs that cost little or nothing. In this short article, we'll concentrate on the common furnace troubleshooting offenders and reveal you what to do about furnace problems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power depends on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a readily available and trusted  source of energy.<p>
