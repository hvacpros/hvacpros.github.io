<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Salem NJ</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
