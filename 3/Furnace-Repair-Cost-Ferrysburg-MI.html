<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
