<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the issue.<p>
