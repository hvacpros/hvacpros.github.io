<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>There are two main forms of glowing flooring heating, or RFH as it's known in the house heating business. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may notice moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
