<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
