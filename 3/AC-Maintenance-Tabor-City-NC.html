<p>My eldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny.

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
