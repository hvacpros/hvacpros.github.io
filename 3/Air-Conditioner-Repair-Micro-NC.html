<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Micro NC</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, apartment or condos, high-rise condos, row real estate, etc.). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), correct filtering, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is operating safely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Filters can get unclean easily, particularly if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and changed frequently. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Examining and changing the air filters is one of the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
