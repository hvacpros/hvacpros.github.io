<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an essential concern to house owners and health specialists. Indoor air contamination studies have identified numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, unpredictable natural compounds (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

First, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
