Indoor air contamination studies have identified numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, ensure that an effective wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
