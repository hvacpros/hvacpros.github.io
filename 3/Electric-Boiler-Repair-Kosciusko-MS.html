<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
