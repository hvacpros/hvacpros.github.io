<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
