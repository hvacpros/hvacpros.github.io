<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Runnemede NJ</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
