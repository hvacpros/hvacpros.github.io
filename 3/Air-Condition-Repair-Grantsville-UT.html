<p>Similar to most house improvement tasks, the cost of a full central heating system can vary commonly based upon the size of the home. The majority of heating systems will last between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, homeowner should consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
