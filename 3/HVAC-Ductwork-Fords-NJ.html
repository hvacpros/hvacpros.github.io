The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
