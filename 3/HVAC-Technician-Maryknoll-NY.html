<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television warms.
