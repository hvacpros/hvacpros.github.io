<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of delays in physical and psychological development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Kids might have higher exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
