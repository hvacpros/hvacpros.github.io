<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>There are numerous things to take into consideration when attempting to determine how typically I need to change my air conditioning filters.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
