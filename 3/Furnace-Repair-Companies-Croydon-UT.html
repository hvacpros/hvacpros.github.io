<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a considerable difference, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
