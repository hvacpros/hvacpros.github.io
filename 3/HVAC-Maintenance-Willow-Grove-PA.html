<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
