When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to install.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
