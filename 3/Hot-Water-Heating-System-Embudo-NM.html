<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
