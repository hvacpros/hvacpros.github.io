<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Rochelle VA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
