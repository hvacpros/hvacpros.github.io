<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Consider possible impacts of indoor air contamination if you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the producer's directions, particularly instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
