<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

If you currently have a house heating unit, you might search for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. Fortunately is that the one major downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the very hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>

A lot of contemporary hot water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the distribution system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air using radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers.
