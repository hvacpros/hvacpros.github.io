<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they identified the concern and repaired really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our house heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
