<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
