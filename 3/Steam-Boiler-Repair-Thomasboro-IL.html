<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to your home for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I required well, and are constantly on-time and professional. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been excellent.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
