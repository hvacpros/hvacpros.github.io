<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Lake Zurich IL</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and bought this Provider and I need to say it gets the job done rather well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool off your house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had before. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
