<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently build up in ductwork, restricting airflow.

When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building (homes usually use in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the best conditions.<p>
