<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
