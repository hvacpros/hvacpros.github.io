<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Kodak TN Home</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
