<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
