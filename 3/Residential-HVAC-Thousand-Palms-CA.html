<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to offer thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside is associated with a higher frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
