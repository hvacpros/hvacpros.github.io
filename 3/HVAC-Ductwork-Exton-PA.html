<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Exton PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
