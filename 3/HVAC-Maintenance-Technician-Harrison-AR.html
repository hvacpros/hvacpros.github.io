<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors eliminate contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Stopped up gutters can lead to water leaking into your house, resulting in mold development, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow essentially anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your home. Exposure to high levels of home mold might trigger mold allergic reaction symptoms. Next time it rains, inspect your rain gutters. If you see water dripping out of end caps, streaming on the outdoors, or dripping behind them, it's time to get out the ladder.<p>
