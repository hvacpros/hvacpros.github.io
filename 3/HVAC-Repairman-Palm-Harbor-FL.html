<p>New furnaces are significantly more efficient than those of 10 or more years ago, cutting costs by as much as 30%.

<p>Plenty of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter modifications throughout Preventative Maintenance sees, individually, as an add on service for you. No 2 systems are exactly the same, however filter modifications are something we offer during PM check outs if the customer requires it- specifically the unattainable filters- since we know how crucial it is that they be changed out & how tough it can be for a resident to do it.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your vehicle.

Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
