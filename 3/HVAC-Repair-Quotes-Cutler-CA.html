<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Numerous aspects impact IAQ. These elements include poor ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air entering the building.
