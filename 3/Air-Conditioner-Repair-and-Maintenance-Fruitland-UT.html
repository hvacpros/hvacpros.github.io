<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Heating is likewise among the greatest energy consumers in your house, so property owners who may be shopping for a new furnace must considering changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient model to conserve cash and assist the environment.
