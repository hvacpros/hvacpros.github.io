<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
