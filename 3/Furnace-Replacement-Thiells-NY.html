<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
