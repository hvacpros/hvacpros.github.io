<p>For example, problems emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient amounts of outside air. Inadequate ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or positioned in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Poorly situated outdoor air consumption vents can likewise bring in air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday.

Location control involves moving the pollutant source far from residents or even transferring susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Since these activities produce large amounts of lead dust, individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or real estate department for ideas on which private laboratories or public companies may have the ability to help test your house for lead in paint. Home test kits can not find small amounts of lead under some conditions. Hire a person with unique training for remedying lead paint issues to remove lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnant ladies, should leave the structure till all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>
