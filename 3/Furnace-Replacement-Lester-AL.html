<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no contaminant sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Lester AL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>If you see a decrease in heat output, first make certain the air filter is clean and in good condition. Next, check other parts of the furnace for any accumulation of dirt, dust and particles, an economical repair that can help boost performance. Likewise, check the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately. Try moving it far from direct sunshine since this may impact temperature readings on the thermostat and trigger it to misread the temperature in your house. If this takes place, your thermostat will shut off the furnace prematurely and leave your home feeling cold. You might also need to inspect your insulation to make sure that warm air does not escape from your area through different openings.<p>
