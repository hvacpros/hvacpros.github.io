He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
