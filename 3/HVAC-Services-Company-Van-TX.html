<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
