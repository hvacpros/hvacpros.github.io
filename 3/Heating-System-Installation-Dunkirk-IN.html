<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Dunkirk IN</h3>

But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
