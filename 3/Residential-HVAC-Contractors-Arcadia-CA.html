<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
