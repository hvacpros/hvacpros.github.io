<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
