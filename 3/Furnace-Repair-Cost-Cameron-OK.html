<p>The purpose of most building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
