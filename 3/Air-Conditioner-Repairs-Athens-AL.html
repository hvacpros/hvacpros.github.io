<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
