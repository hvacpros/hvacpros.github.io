<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
