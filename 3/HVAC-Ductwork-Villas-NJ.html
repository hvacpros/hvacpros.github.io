As an outcome your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to provide the very same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy costs to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies on a monthly basis might be used to help you pay for a brand-new, much more energy-efficient and energy saving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating expenses from the previous years. If there is a substantial distinction, then it's time to change your furnace.<p>
