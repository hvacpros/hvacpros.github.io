Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
