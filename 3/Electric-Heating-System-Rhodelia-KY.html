<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Rhodelia KY</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I went ahead and purchased this Provider and I need to say it gets the job done quite well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool down your house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
