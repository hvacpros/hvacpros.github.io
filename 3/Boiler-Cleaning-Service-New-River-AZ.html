<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
