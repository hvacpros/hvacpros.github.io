<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into account not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
