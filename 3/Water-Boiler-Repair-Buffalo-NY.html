This identifies the heat gain your home goes through. The estimation is relatively easy to perform and will expose what size unit you need. Proceed to another contractor if the one you're thinking about wants to determine the best system for your house exclusively on experience. Though strongly affected by where you live, numerous elements impact the size system needed, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun.

It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
