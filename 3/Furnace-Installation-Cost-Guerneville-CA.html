<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
