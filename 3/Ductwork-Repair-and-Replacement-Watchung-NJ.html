<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
