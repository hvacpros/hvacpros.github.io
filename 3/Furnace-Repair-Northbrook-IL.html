<p>Terrific Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center..

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Northbrook IL</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is honest, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
