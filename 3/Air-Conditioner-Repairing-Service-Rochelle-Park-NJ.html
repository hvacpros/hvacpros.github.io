<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and respected my house by constantly wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of inspection and also recommended I have a UV light set up due to a little buildup of mold building up in the air handler, which he thoroughly cleaned up the outside and checked compressor coils as well as ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He also removed the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor unit and advised a solution to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received an in-depth e-mail report of the inspection detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly recommend him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
