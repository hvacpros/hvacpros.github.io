<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
