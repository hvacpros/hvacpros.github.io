Such information can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company.

Review of this data may identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
