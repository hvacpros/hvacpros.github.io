<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
