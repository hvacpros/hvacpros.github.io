<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
