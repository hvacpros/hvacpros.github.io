Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
