<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Lake Monroe FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
