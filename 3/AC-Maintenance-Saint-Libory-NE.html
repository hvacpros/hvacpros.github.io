<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room a/c unit. In addition, they run out the method, quiet, and convenient to run. To conserve energy and cash, you must shop an energy-efficient a/c unit and minimize your central air conditioner's energy usage.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
