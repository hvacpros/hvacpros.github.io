<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
