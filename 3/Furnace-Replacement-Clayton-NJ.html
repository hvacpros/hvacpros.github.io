<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care items.
