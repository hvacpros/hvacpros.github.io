And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
