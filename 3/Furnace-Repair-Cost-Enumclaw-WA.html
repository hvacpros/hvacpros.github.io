<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Enumclaw WA</h3>
<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Normally the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
