<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that ideal temperature level all year round.

So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
