<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floorings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
