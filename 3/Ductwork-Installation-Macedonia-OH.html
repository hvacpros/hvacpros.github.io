<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, industrial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
