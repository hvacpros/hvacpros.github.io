<p>It may just need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether or not this is the reason for the problem, it's a good early solution to attempt. Plan to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never utilize a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins. The following are standards; always refer to your owner's handbook.
