<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
