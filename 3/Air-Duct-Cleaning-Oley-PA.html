<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If products with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent gos to, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
