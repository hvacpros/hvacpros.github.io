<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit. Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
