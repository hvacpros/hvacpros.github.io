<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical energy, a heat pump is an economical solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated effectiveness benefit. Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>
