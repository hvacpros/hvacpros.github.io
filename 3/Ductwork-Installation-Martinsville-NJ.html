<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance check outs per year, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and generally some other benefits. Some companies use concern appointments to their maintenance plan members.<p>
