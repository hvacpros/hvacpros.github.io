<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
