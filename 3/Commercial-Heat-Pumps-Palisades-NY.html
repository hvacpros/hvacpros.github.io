<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Palisades NY</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might set off attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some people can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been shown to trigger cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>There's a huge difference between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of houses in colder environments were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the ceilings, walls and floorings heated up. In turn, the items in the room, like furniture and people, would stay warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to reduce levels of radon and its decay items. Since they just partly remove the radon decay items and do not reduce the amount of radon going into the house, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA prepares to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or could end up being, a trustworthy means of lowering the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies more info on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.
