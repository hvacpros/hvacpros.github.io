<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
