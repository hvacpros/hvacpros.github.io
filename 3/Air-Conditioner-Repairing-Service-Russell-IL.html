<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
