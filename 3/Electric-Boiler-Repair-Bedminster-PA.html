<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

Next, examine other components of the furnace for any build-up of debris, dust and dirt, an inexpensive repair that can help improve efficiency. Also, check the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, make certain the thermostat is working and positioned correctly. Try moving it away from direct sunlight because this might impact temperature readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your house. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this takes place.

The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
