Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside is related to a greater occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to flow and rise out high structure openings to the outside (stack effect ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, but care must be taken to make sure convenience. In damp or warm environments, preserving thermal comfort exclusively by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition spaces, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
