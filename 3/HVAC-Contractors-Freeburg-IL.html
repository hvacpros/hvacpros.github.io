<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency.

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
