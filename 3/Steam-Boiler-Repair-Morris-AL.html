<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Morris AL</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
