<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
