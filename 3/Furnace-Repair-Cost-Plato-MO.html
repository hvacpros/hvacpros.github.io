<p>Heating units are devices whose function is to produce heat (i.e. heat) for the structure. This can be done by means of central heating Such a system includes a boiler, heat, or furnace  pump to heat water, steam, or air in a central area such as a furnace space in a house, or a mechanical room in a big structure. The heat can be transferred by convection, radiation, or conduction Space heating systems are utilized to heat single rooms and only include a single unit.<p>
<p>Energy efficiency can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to preserving a correct temperature level.<p>
