<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Salford PA?</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really knowledgeable. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was obviously reasonable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
