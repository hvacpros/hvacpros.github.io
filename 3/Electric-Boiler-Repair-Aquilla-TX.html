<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for property owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
