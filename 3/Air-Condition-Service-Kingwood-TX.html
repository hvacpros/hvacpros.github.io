<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
