<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot beside the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
