<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Chatham NJ</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
