<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Walkerton</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean substantial cost savings in annual heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
