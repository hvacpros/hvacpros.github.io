<h3>Heater Repair in Mertztown PA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
