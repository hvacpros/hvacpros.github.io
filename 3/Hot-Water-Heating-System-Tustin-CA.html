<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the flooring.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents.
