<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
