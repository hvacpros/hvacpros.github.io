<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Fox River Grove IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
