<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years.
