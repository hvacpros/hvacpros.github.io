<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
