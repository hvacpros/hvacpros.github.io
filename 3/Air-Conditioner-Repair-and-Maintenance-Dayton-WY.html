<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Dayton WY</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in autos in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
