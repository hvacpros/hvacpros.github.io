<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue.
