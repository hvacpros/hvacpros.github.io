<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
