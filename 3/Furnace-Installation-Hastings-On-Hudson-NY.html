<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
