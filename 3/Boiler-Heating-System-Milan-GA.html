<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been shown to trigger the health effects pointed out. However, it is not necessarily real that the impacts noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically discovered in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed results might take place.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, talk to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
