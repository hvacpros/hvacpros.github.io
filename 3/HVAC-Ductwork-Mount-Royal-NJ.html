<p>An undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Because it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
