Start by opening the heat registers and then proceed to examining the thermostat settings. Next, check the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can likewise examine the filter to make sure it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot light to ensure it is lit.<p>

The reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.
