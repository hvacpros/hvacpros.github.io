<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
