The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began.
