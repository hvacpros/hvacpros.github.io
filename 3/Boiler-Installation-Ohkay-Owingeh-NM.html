<p>The heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heat pumps can extract heat from different sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground. Heatpump move heat from outside the structure into the air inside. Initially, heat pump HVAC systems were just utilized in moderate environments, however with enhancements in low temperature level operation and minimized loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in popularity in cooler environments.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
