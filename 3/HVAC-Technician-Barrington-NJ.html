<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
