Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
