<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
