<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Washington NE</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is generally used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option in between the 2 types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
