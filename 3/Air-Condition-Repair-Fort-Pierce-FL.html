<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.
