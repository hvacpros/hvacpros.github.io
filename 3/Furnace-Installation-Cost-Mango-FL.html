<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation business totally turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to three months.

<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those measurements on hand. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the a/c: Don't position it in an egress window that works as the only means of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>

Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is effectively matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be better to replace the whole system.<p>
