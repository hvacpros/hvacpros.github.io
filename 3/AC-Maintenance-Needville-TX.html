<p>Chemical contaminants: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
