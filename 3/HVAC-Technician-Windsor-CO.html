Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly adverse dust.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
