<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it just takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
