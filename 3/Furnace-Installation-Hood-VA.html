<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
