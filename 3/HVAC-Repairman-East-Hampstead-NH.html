<h3>Air Conditioning Contractors in East Hampstead NH</h3>
<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must likewise be required to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners must be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out until these problems have been fixed.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
