<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use.

While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
