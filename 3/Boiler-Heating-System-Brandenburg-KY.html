<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
