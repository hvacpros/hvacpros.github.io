<p>The job growth in this field is credited to the expected increase in building construction combined with the reality that climate control systems are becoming more typical.

<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
