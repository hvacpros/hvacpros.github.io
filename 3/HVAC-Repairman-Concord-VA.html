<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
