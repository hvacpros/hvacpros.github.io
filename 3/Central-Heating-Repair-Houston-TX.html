<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>

People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
