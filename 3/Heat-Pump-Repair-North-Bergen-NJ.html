<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace.

Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion procedure. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey.<p>

<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that resistance varies considerably from private to individual, it is not practical to create a universal guideline fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health.

The building type included both residential and commercial. The majority of samples evaluated were checked favorable for fungis and bacteria.<p>
