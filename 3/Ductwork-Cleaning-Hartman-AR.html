<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Prior to it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If you believe there is a health issue associated to the indoor environment, please schedule an appointment for a medical evaluation at the University Staff Member Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119.

When completing the demand that you supply as much detail as possible for the EHS Responder, please submit and complete the form via email or fax It is essential.<p>
<p>In some cases a short-term indoor air quality issue is produced merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complicated problems-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the three techniques below may be appropriate.<p>
