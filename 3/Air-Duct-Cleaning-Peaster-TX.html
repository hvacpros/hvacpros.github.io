<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
