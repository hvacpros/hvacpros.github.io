<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.

For instance, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to fractures and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.. an extremely advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
