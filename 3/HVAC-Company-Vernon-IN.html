I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
