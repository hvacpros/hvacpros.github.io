<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should look out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
