Since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
