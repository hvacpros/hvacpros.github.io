<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
