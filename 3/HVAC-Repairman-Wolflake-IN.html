<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating units are still widely used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in concentrations and buildings build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>
