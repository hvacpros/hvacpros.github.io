<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
