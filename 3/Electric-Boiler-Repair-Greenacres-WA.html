<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to supply enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
