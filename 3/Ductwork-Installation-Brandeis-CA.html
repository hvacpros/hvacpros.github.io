<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Brandeis CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Modification the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned due to the fact that the soot builds up inside the ducts, lowering their performance in time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
