<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production integrates quality products and exceptional service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating and cooling products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several spaces with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning system there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>
<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
