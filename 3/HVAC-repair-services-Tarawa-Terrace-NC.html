<p>UW workers, visitors and trainees should have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform various activities. If the air quality is bad it can impact a person's performance, convenience, and health.  The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to provide and preserve healthy and comfortable environments free of pollutants. A key part of the program is reacting to and dealing with concerns of structure occupants about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply advice to change rather than repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues.
