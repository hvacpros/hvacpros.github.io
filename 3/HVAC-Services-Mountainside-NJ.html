<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has watched the single-family house installation business entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
