<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
