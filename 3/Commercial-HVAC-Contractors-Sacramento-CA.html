<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
