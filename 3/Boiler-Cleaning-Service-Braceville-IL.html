<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
