<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Mentioning air, radiant heating systems tend to improve indoor air quality.

Radiant heat systems don't circulate air at all, which actually enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as an automobile radiator or common home air conditioning unit does.
