<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become a crucial issue to property owners and health experts. Indoor air contamination studies have determined numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these contaminants are essential in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.

Exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations construct up inside.<p>
<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Pacoima CA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
