<p>Particular immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently difficult to identify if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is very important to pay attention to the time and place the signs happen. If the signs fade or go away when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions common in the house.<p>
<p>There are some more serious risks for HVAC workers that could be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be harmful.

<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
