As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
