Location the air conditioning unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
