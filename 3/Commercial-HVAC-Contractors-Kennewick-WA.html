<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at sensible energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J calculation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. As with determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, figuring out the correct size of unit for your home likewise depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
