<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
