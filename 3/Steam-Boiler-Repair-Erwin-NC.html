<p>Last week, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were stolen from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now inform KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually operated at a variety of locations at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
