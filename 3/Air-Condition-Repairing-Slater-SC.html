Elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often suggested instead.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
