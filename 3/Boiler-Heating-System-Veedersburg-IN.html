<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. A skilled technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
