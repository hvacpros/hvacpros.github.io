<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Rion SC</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
