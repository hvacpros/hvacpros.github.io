<h3>AC Compressor in Cliffside Park NJ</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>There are some more major risks for HVAC workers that might be potentially fatal. They can be exposed to Carbon monoxide gas which can be toxic. As HVAC technicians regularly come into contact with circuitry, they run the risk of being electrocuted. They can also suffer other types of abrasions and burns to the skin. Although there are dangers associated with the job, it is typically performed securely as long as proper care is taken.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
