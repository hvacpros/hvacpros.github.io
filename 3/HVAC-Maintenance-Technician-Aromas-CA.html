<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that best temperature all year round.

So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
