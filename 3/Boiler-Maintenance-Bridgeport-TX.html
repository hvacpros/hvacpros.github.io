<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Bridgeport TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
