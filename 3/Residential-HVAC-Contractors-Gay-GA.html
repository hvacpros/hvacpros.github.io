<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost.
