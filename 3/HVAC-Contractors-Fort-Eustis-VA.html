<p>I have actually ended up being fairly proficient at looking into items on line prior to buying them. Nevertheless I don't discover that there is a central location for searching information about the "true" value of home HVAC systems or maybe I need to say an honest assessment of these products. Due to the fact that they are actually taxed in the summer season, given that I live in FL it is critical to have a good AC unit in your home.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
