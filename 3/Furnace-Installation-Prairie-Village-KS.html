<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not changing the entire part. He got along, straightforward and a thoroughly enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and expertise to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>

The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel very hot. Only be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not appear to be working effectively, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you must contact a specialist to inspect and repair the unit.<p>

<p>Have you been asking yourself which heating system do I require?" Or are you not sure how to choose the very best heating unit?

The couple of times we have needed them for emergency situations they responded quickly and solved the problem.<p>

He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance jobs we might want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the market.<p>
