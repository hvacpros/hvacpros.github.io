<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget-friendly if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
