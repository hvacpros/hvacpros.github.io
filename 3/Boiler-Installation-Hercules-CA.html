<p>These people have actually been great. At a real estate agent, I in some cases require contractors to provide me a viewpoint for what work on a home might cost. Recently I required to contact these men twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Stability isn't just their name, its a service design they take seriously.

<p>Great Product! Shipment was type of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged.

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Hercules CA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC specialists. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by numerous individuals.<p>
