<p>Enhance your services, earn more services profits, and offer an amazing client experience. To make sure the unit you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to figure out the exact type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not just replace it with the very same size system you currently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is necessary so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could result in fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
