<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
