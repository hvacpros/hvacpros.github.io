<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
