These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's five years of ages or older.
