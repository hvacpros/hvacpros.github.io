<h2>How To Hire HVAC Service in Damon</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC professionals like Dave Mejean of B&W Plumbing & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that include owning a high-demand, seasonal organisation. A thoroughly crafted company plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to manage those peaks and lulls so your revenues stay healthy year-round.

<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>All heater have some level of air filtering. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
