<p>Appropriate ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same contaminants.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
