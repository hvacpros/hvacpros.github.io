<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
