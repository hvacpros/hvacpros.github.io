<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
