<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
