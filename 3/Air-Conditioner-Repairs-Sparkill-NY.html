<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really practical in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
