Depending upon the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
