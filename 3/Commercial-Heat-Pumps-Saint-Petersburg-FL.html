<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.

<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of strange being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
