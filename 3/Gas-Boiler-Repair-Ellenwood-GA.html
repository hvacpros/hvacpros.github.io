<p>Sean was really handy. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
