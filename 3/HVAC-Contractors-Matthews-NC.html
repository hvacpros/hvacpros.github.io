<p>Immediate discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are offered to devices installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Client Service! Climate Pro is reliable and genuinely cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might search for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely grateful to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
