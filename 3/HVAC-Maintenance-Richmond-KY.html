<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing in Richmond KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness.

<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the difficulty location in looking over the costs. He resolved the issue in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, knew what might have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
