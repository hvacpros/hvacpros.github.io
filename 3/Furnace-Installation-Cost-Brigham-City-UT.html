<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly appear higher than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system.

The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>

When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air may also be an issue.<p>
<p>A lot of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter modifications during Preventative Maintenance check outs, individually, as an include on service for you.
