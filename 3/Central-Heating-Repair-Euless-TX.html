<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
