<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
