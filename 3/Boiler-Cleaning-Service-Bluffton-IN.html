<p>For example, impurities might collect within the air diffusers and grills, presenting contaminants into the environment.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
