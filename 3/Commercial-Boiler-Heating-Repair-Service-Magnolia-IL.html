<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you hire to install your central air conditioning unit. In fact, you can even Do It Yourself, in spite of our strong recommendation not to do so.

Furthermore, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for additional products and devices.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
