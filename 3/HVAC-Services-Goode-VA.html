<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
