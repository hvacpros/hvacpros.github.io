Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes typically utilize between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.

This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heatpump While room cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
