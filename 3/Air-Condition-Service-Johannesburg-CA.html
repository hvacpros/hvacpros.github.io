<p>To set up a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your area in an online search.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of new houses are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home.
