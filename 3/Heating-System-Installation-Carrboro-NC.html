<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
