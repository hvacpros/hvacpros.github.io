<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other types of heat pumps, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of determining how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Most geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every single system of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>
