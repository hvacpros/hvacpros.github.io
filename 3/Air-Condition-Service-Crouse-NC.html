<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Crouse NC</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>

This can lead to the potential for considerable health issue.<p>
