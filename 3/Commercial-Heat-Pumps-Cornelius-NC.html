<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Cornelius NC</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the essential evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
