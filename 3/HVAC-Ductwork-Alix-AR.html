When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost evaluation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you choose for your home.

<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Alix AR</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
