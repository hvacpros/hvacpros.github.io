<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective.

There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
