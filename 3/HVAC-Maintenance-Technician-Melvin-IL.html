<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Melvin IL</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate go bad on uncommon occasions.<p>
