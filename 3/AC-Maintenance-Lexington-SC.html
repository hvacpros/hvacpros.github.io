<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by the majority of public water materials, it has actually been found in well water.

Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one component (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>

Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a harsh, terrible summer.<p>
