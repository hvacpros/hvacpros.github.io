<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going however also replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from starting to end were extremely expert, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System since of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may end up being blocked, lowering air flow quality, volume, and circulation.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be correctly kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>No matter the kind of electric radiant floor heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any disturbance or interruption in the flow of electrical energy makes the system unusable. This is among the drawbacks to setting up an electric convected heat system. However, assuming they are set up correctly and properly looked after, the probability of them having problems is little.<p>
