This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
