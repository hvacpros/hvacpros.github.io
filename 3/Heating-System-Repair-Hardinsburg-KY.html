<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
