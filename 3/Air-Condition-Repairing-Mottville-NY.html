<p>These men have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I often need contractors to give me an opinion for what deal with a house may cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
