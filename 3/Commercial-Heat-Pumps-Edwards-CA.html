The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not diminish the amount of radon getting in the home.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more info on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>You ought to always hire a professional to carry out AC repair, for the same reason that you trust a professional plumber or electrician. You don't carry out repairs on your own pipes system, or replace your own electrical grid. The reasons that you do not do those things are apparent. You do not have the tools, or the know-how, to be sure that you carry out those procedures securely and properly. Experts, however, do have the tools and expertise to do the task correctly. A/c repair is no different. You always wish to hire a professional to repair your system, so you can have the comfort associated trusting an expert in the field.<p>
<p>Consider an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
