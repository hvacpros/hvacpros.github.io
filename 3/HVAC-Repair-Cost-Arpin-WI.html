<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
