<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

But more complicated concerns-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques below might be appropriate.<p>
