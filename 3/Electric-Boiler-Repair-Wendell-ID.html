<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Buildings constantly progress as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be evolving as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be changed eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air systems and heat pumps normally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life-span, replacement might be the most economical solution.<p>
