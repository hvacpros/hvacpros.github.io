<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried.
