<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without can be found in contact with the actual flame or burner area.
