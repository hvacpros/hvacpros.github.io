<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
