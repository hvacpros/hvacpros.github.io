<p>There are 2 primary types of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's understood in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist existing, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>The pollutants noted in this guide have been revealed to cause the health results mentioned.

<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors.
