<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor.
