<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

Transmittable health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of health problems brought on by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
