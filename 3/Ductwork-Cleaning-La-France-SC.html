However, if your system does not seem working effectively, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.

<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
