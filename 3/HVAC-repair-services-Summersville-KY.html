<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are expert and very knowledgeable. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser this week. Due to the fact that the cost was clearly reasonable, I did not bother to get rival's quotes since of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
