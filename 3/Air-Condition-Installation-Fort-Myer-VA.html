The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Given that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more efficient. This was initially driven by rising energy expenses, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.

There are a number of methods for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
