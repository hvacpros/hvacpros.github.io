<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied great customer service at the end of the visit by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the market.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the space.

These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
