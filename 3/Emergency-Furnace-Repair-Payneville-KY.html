From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some fundamental maintenance.

<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
