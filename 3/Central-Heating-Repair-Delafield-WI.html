<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
