Pressed wood products produced indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
