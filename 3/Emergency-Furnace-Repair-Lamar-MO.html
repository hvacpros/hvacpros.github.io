<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
