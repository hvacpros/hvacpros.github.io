If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a laboratory accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon issues in water can be readily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a uncomplicated and efficient  method to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
