One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to withstand current, which then generates heat.<p>
