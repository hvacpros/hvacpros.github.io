<p>I generally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
