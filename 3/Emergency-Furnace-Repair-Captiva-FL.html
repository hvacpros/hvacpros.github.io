<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
