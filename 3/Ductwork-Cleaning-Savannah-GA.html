<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
