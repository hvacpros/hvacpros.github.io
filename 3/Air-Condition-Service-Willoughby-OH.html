<h3>What to Look for When Hiring an Willoughby OH HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature is constantly at a constant temperature.

Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
