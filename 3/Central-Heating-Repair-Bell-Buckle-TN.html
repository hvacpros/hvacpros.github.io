<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Bell Buckle TN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
