<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Bismarck IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
