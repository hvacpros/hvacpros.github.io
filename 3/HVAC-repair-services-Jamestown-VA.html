<p>The first air conditioning unit and refrigerators used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Many contemporary air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible citation needed to minimize the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature level falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut down to mitigate further temperature level drops; clarification required this prevents wetness on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation needed When the temperature increases once again, clarification required the compressor reboots and the fan returns to low speed.<p>

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more tough to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
