<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions.

Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold growth and moisture indoors is related to a higher occurrence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
