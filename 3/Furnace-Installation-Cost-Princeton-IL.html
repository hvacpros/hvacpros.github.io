<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
