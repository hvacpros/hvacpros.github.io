<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes.

If you've installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
