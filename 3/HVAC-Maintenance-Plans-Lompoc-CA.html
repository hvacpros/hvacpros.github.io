<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been effectively dried. Try a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
