<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often tough to measure, as one reaction stated the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
