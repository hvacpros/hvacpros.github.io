<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

(He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
