<p>. Prior to picking the installation location of a/c unit, a number of main aspects require to be thought about. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units must not fall on the location of rest or work area.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
