Because the cost was undoubtedly reasonable, I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
