<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
