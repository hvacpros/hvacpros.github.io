<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
