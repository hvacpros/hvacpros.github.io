There are numerous style techniques in use today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and very large residences.

A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
