<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity specialist at a big merchant who asked not to be called since he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps track of energy intake and temperatures in stores to save on expenses (especially at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperature levels in the stores change beyond an appropriate range that might prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless hazardous gas. Due to the fact that it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you understand it is in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate results that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, queasiness, disorientation and tiredness. The effects of CO exposure can vary significantly from individual to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
