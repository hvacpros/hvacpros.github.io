In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
