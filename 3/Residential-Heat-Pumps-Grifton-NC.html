<p>Airflow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne pollutants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants: the biological pollutants can include bacteria, infections, fungi (mold), allergen allergen, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach irritant, etc. and may arise from insufficient maintenance and housekeeping, water spills, inadequate humidity control, condensation, or might be brought into the building by occupants, infiltration, or ventilation air. Allergic actions to indoor biological contaminant exposures trigger symptoms in allergic people and also play a key role in activating asthma episodes for an approximated 15 million Americans.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, consider the height at which they should be put. Many typically they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if individuals mostly remain seated in that specific location. Nevertheless, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll require to put the sensor accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
