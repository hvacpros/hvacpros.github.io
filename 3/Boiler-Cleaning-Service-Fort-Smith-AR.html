<p>Santa Clarita Custom Air offers complimentary in-home assessments for brand-new furnace setups in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando Valley. Throughout a consultation, our owner and project supervisor will come out to talk with you about your heating problems and preferences. Then, we will stroll through your home to evaluate the existing system, evaluate your ductwork, look for leaky windows, and take measurements of each room.

Airborne aspects from typical home items and surface areas can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC equipment.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is an extremely typical repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, think about having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Fort Smith AR</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is because something is stopped up or dirty Prior to attempting to fix any issue, require time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is good to go, check the furnace blower for clogging and tidy it. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Room air conditioners include a thermostat sensing unit, located behind the control panel, which measures the temperature of air coming into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle constantly or behave erratically if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensor needs to be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>
