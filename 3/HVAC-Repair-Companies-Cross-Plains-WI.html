<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
