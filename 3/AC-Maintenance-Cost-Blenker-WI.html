<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a cruel, terrible summer season.<p>
