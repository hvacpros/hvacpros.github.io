<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
