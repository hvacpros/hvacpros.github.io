When you do observe your furnace acting oddly, it is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
