<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are great for additions due to the fact that they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
