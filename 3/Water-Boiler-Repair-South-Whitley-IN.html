The EPA study recommended and controlled methods utilized on a smaller sized variety of houses.

<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.
