<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
