<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.
