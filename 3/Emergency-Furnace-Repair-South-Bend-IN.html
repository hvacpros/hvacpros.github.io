We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>Using air filters can trap a few of the air pollutants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Filtering should have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are utilized to lower the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your car.

During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
