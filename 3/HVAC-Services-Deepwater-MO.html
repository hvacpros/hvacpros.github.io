<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate.

A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively.

Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
