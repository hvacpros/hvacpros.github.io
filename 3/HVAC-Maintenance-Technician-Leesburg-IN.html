<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping machine to flow warm water that warmed their stone floorings.
