<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same method as a vehicle radiator or typical family a/c does.
