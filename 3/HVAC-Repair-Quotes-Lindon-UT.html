<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
