<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
