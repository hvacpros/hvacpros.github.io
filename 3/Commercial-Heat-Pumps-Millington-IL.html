<p>A specialized ac system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. A standard a/c transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
