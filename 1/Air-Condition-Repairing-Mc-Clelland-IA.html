<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
