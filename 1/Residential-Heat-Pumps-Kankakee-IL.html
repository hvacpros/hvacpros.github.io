<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
