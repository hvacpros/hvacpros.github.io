<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Pomona CA</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
