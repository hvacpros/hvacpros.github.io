<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use.

Heating systems that kick on frequently might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
