<p>We got in touch with Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate circumstance & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were extremely professional, considerate and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>

<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to offer threshold signals. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could establish your monitoring equipment to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to resolve the scenario immediately.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
