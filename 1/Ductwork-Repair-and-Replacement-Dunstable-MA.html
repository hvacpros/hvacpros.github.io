<p>The probability of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxic substances. Signs of illness brought on by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
