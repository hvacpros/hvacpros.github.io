<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Hermanville MS</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and practical, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these significant however minor modifications in his quote. We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
