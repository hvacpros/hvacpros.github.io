<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Stone Mountain GA Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently set up in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heat pump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in collecting info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day.
