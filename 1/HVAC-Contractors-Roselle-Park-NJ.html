<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
