<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
