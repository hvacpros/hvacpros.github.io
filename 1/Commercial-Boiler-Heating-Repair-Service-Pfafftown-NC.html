<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
