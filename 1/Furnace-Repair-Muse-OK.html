<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
