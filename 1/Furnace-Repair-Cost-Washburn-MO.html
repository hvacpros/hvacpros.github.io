<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

This area takes a source-by-source look at the most common indoor air pollutants, their possible health impacts, and methods to minimize levels in the home.
