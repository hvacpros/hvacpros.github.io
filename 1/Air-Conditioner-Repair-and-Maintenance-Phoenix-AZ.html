<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>
