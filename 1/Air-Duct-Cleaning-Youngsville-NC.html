<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician inspect the system regularly.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
