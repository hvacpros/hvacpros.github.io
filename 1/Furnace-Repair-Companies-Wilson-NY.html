<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
