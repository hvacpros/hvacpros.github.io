<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Because it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you know it is in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are often mistaken for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue and queasiness. The results of CO exposure can differ greatly from person to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
