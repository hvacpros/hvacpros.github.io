After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
