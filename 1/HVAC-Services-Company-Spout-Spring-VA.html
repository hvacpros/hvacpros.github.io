<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Spout Spring VA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the required electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
