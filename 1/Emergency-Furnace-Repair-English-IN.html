<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
