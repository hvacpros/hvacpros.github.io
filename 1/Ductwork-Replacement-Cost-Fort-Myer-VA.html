<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Fort Myer</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
