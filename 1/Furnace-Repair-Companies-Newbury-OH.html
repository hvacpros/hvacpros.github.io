<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly lowers exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect change, typically suggested by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Think about buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
