<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated concentrations on the job; some developed illness from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought house from task sites.<p>
