<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
