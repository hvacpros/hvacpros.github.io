<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
