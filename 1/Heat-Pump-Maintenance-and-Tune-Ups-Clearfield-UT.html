<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air.
