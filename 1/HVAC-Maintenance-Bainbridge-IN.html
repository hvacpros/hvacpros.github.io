<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
