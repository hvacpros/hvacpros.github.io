The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

In turn, the things in the room, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
