<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
