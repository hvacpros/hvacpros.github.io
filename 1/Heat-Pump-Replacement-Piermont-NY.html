<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
