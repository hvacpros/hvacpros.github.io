<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Contractor in South Amboy</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
