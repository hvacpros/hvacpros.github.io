<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>Heat Pump Water Heater in Lake Waccamaw NC</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each room in your house, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having defective ductwork makes your system work harder with worse results. Your home will not be adequately cooled, and your energy expenses will go up. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better service. If the present system has actually not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your house is located, the local region's climate can alter significantly. A house located in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would need a much larger heating capability also which will impact costs. See the chart below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement costs by LOADS.<p>
