<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Utilize specialists and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated specialists carry out much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.
