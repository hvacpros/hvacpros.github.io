<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
