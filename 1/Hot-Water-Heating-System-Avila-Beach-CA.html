<p>While pollutant levels from private sources might not pose a substantial health threat on their own, a lot of houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a major risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that many people can take both to decrease the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place.

Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical toxins as well.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided.
