<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
