<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
