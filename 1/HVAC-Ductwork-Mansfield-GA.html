<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
