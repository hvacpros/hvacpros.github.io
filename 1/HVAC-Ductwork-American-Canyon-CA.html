Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
