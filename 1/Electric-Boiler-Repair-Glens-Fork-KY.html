<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
