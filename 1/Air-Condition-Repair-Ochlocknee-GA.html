<h3>AC Maintenance in Ochlocknee GA</h3>
<p>To figure out the proper size of oil furnace you require for your house, determine the home's square video footage and determine what zone your home is in. Consult the U.S. Energy Details Administration's climate zone map to determine your zone number. Multiply the length and width of each room in your house that you heat and add up all the rooms together to get your overall square video footage.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are usually not extremely effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by using a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Due to the fact that a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Advanced designs of brand-new homes are beginning to include mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house.

For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Preservation and Renewable Energy Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
