<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate situation & decided to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however also replaced the heating unit which was old.

<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces.

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
