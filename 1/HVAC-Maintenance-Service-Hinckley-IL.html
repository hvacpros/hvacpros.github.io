<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at sensible energy expenses. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for a/c. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square video alone, relocate to another contractor.

My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way.
