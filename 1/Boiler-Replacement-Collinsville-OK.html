The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the home.<p>
<p>There are several variables that contribute to indoor air contamination. Such aspects include using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide gas produced by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents utilized in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
