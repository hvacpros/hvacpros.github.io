<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and simple method to reduce ambient air contamination and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to supply threshold signals. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the proper action to deal with the circumstance instantly.<p>
