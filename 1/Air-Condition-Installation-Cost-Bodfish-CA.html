<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
