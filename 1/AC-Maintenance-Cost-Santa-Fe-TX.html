<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
