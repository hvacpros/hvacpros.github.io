<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
