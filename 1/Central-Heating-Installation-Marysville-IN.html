<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
