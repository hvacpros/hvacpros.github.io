<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and moisture inside your home is connected with a higher occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Particular types of HVAC systems are a little more costly than wall systems, ceiling or cassette systems are neatly hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are for that reason more discreet and aesthetically pleasing to take a look at.

Ducted commercial-grade air conditioning systems are BETTER for the instructional environment. They are typically the most costly choice; nevertheless, they are also the most aesthetically pleasing as the duct-work and internal units concealed with minimal visibility.<p>
