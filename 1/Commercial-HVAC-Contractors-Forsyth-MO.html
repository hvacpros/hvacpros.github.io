<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
