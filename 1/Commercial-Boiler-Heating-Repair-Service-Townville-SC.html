<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
