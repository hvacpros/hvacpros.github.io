<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Try a various dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
