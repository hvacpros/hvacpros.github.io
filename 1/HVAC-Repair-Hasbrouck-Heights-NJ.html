<p>There are lots of actions a house owner can take to select items that will avoid indoor air issues from taking place - a couple of them are pointed out here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood items.
