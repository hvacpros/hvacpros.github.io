<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
