<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in Saint Charles MO</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
