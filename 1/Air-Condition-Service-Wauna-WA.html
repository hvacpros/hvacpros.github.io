We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
