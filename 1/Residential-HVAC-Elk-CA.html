Due to these reasons, the task development for this occupation is greater than average.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
