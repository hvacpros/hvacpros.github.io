<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again. He is sincere, trusted, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find a sincere AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
