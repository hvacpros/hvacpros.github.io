The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items.
