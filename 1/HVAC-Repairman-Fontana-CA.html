<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
