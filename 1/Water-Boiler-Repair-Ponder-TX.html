<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for resident comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or unit cost for cooling.

Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of system for your home also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
