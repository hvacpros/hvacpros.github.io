<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he recommended me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to find an honest AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
