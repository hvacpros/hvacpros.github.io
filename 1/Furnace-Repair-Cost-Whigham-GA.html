If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor. As with determining the size of an unit required based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of system for your home likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system manufacturers typically make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c unit fails, begin by examining any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the system cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
