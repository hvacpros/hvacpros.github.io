<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, merely adding refrigerant is not a solution. A skilled technician must repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions since they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because a system is installed in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
