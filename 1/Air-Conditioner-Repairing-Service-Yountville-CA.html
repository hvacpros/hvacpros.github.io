<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
