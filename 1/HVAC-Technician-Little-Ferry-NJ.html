<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Little Ferry NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
