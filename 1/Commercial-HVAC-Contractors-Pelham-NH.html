<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally brought on by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home.

These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big photo" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to provide threshold notifies. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might establish your monitoring equipment to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to resolve the circumstance right away.<p>
