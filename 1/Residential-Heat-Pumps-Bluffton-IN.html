<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace two furnaces in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building products, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch pollutants basically continually.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
