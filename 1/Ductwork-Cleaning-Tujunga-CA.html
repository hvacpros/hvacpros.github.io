We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
