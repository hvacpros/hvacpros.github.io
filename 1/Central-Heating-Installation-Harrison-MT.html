<p>Before you select a contractor, consider bids from a minimum of three to five reputable contractors. Contact your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no consumer complaints have actually been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is active and legitimate. Compare the different furnace effectiveness scores recommended by the individual contractors to choose the design and system that best suits your energy needs. Remember that energy-star ranked devices will conserve you cash in the end however might involve a higher up-front cost.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
