<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
