<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
