<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior.
