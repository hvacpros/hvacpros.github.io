Stale indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
