<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Stirling NJ Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have maintained my system semi-annually. Their techs are professional and really well-informed. Expenses are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff since the cost was clearly sensible.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
