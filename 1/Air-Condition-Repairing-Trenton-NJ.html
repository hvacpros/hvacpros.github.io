<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever requires to be changed ultimately. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement may be the most cost-efficient solution.<p>
