<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
