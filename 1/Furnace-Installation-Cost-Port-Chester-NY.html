Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
