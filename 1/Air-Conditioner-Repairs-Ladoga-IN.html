There have been uncomfortable sounds. I got it examined and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the beginning. But then understood ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
