In general, heating systems are the most economical choice. However, your option will mostly boil down to what your ducts enable or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most proper choice.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
