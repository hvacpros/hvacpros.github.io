<p>Specialist heating unit setups. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these companies offer chances they can't attain on their own. Many owners stick with the larger companies after acquisition. In many cases, the acquisition provides a way for the seller to retire and make certain employees are taken care of. For the many part, the obtaining companies want the owner to remain.

<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like a space heating unit) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems flow airborne pollutants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a variety of various unfavorable results. Radiant heat systems do not flow air at all, which really improves your indoor air quality by restricting your exposure to high levels of airborne contaminants.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
