<p>My eldest kid constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our options did an exceptional job in making sure we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each choice.
