<p>The probability of instant responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies greatly from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
