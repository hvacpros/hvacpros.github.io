Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
