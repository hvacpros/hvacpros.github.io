<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many typical building materials utilized before 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure materials are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often suggested instead.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
