<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
