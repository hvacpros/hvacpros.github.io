Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think of anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itÃ¢ $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
