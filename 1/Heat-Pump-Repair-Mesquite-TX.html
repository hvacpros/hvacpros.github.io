<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a simple and efficient  technique to decrease ambient air pollution and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home.

To detect odors in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
