<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
