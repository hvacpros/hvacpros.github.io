<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair at Merton WI</h3>
<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
