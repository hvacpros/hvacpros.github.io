<h3>HVAC Cleaning in Ammon VA</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
