<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now.

He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
