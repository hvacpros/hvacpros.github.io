<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
