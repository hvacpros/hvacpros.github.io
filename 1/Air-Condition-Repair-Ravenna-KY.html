<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
