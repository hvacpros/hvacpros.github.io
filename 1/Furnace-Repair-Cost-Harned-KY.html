<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
