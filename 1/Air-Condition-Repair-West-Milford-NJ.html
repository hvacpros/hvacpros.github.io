<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
