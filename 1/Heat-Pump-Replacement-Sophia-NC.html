<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
