<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
