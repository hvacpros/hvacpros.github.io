<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>There are two main types of glowing floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to withstand current, which then produces heat.<p>
