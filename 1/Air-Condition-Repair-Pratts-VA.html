<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
