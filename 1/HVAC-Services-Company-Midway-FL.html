<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Merely adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. An experienced technician must repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
