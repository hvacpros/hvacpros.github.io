<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.
