They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; floor, furnishings and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 must be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
