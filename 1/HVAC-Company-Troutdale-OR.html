<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
