<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
