<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The main hazard of mold development, as it connects to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall.

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a company was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>

However, a geothermal installation normally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which typically indicates it fails in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively.
