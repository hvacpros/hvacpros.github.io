<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
