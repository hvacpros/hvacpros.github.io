<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd issue that periodically shows up. It is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible when you do see your furnace acting strangely. The faster you react to problems with your furnace, the simpler they are to repair. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the problem worse, and often more costly.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Air, ventilation and heating Conditioning, and refers to the climate control systems set up in houses or commercial homes. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the building, to keep inhabitants of the structure comfortable. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of climate control system installed.<p>
