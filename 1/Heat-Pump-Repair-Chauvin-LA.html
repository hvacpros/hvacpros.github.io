<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
