<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started.
