<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
