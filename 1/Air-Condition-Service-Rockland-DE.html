<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
