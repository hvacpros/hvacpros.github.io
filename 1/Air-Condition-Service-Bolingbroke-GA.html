<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should assess and, if required, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new structure.

The size of geothermal heat pump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating & cooling requirements for your home and is important iin making sure the effectiveness and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Typically, a 3-ton setup should be enough for the average home, however home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all elements which will affect the proper size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you effectively size a system.<p>

<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home.

Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
