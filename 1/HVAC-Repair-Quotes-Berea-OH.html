Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Space air conditioners feature a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control panel, which determines the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle constantly or behave erratically if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensing unit should be near the coil however not touching it; change its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in location.<p>
