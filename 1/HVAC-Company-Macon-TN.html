<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the check out. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas heating systems While oil is traditionally utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the same, around $6,000 for a high-efficiency unit. The real benefit of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks include 2 cartridge fuses. Inspect them before you continue with repairs (Image 3). A blown fuse suggests a failing part inside the condensing unit. So don't simply replace it and believe you have actually resolved the problem. Instead, replace the parts we reveal here. Then set up brand-new merges and fire up the unit. If it blows again, call a pro-- you've got more serious problems.<p>
