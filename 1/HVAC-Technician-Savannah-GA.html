Your heating and cooling contractor ought to assess and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling issues than replacing your devices.<p>
