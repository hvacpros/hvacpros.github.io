<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
