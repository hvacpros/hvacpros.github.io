<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>
