Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
