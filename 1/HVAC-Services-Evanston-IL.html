<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>A SEER score stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the same period. Generally, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER performs in various temps. The higher the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all appliances.<p>

A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
