<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.
