<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The purpose of the majority of structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J calculation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, identifying the right size of unit for your house likewise depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
