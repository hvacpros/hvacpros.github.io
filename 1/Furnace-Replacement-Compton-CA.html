<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
