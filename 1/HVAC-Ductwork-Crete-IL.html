<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
