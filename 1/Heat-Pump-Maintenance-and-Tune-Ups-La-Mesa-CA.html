<p>A customized ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
