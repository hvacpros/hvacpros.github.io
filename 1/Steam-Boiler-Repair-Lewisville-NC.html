<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the unit.

<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
