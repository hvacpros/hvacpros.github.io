<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
