Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
