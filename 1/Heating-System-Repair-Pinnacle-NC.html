The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it collects pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
