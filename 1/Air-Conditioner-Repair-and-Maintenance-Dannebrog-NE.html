<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, automobiles such as automobiles, trains, ships, planes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your home might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To detect odors in your home, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether odors are visible.<p>

Roughly 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
