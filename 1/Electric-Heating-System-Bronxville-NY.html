The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in over half the workplace indoor air examinations it has performed.

<p>PE firms tend to operate with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This might be through a public offering, a sale to a big company in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE firm. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for three years before that.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you every time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
