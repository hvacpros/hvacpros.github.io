Depending on the type of system installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust. Additionally, specific fuels and equipment may need special permits, and there is limited flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating system to the living space.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
