<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Grabill IN</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
