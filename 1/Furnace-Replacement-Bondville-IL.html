<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
