<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<h3>HVAC Contractors Near Me in High Shoals NC</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was incredible, useful and informative - his work was flawless! All of his assistants were respectful and diligent. The work site was left entirely cleared and cleaned. We would highly motivate others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>

Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
