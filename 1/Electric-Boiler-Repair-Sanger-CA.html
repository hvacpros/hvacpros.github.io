<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
