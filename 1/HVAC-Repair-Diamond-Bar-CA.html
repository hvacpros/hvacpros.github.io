<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, work environments and schools matters, particularly because we spend most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
