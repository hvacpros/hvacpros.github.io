They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is safeguarded indoors.
