Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
