<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
