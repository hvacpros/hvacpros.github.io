<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
