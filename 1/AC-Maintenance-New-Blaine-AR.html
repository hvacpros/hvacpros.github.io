<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in New Blaine AR</h3>
<p>Many people do not know how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the damp hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC system is not draining properly. A restriction in your drainage pipes causes a water leak. There are various places a blockage can occur. One of the primary areas where clogs start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually occur. In many cases, the belt is poorly lined up or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under Air conditioning system Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
