The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems need to be examined a minimum of twice per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
