<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
