<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and grime will often build up in ductwork, limiting air flow. Because ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really daunting in the beginning, needing specialized tools, devices, and know-how. When you choose Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Since an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
