<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
