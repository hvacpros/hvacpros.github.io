<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
