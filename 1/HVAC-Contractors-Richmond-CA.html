<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Since employee incomes and other HR expenses will likely be the most significant expense for any HVAC business that works with personnel, we're breaking this product out of the general discussion of financial projections and into its own classification.
