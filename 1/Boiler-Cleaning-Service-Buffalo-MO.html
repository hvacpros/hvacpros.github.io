<p>We look at ideas before we supply suggestions to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Consider a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement.
