<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
