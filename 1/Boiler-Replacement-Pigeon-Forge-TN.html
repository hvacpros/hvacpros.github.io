<h3>Air Conditioning Installation Cost in Pigeon Forge TN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
