<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. There are numerous design techniques in use today; however, all ground source heatpump run with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth.
