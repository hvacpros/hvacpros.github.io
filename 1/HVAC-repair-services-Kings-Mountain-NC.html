<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Kings Mountain NC?</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON.

You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
