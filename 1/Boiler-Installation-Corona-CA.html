This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
