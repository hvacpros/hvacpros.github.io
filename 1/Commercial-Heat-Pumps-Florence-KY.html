<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer guidance to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.

It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
