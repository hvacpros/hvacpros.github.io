<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>We included a brand-new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and needed some heating. After calling Stability we were provided an excellent quote on a glowing flooring system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us linked in a number of days. The systems works terrific and the new office feels very comfy. It was an enjoyment working with such an expert company and would highly suggest them to anybody looking for HVAC.<p>
