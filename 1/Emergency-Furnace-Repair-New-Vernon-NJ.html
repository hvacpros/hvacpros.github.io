<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.

Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
