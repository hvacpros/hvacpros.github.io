<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous rooms simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this may spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
