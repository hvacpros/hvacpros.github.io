It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
