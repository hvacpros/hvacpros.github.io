<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
