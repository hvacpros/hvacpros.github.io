<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
