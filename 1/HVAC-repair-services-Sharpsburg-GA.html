<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
