<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
