<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
