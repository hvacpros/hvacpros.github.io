<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
