<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Rio Linda CA</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofs. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>First make sure the air filter is tidy and in great condition if you notice a decline in heat output. Next, examine other parts of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, dust and debris, an economical fix that can help boost performance. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned properly. Attempt moving it away from direct sunshine given that this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature level in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this happens. You may also need to check your insulation to make certain that warm air does not leave from your area through various openings.<p>
