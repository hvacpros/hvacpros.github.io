<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
