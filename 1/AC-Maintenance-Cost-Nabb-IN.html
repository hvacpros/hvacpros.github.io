<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
