<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and hence, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could induce an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, however not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer adequate changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
