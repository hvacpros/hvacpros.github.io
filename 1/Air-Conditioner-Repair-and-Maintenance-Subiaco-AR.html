<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
