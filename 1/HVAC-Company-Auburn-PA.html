<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Auburn PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
