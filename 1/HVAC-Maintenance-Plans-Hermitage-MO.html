Dust can act as food to grow molds on the wet coils and ducts and can lower the effectiveness of the coils.<p>

<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they must be put. Many frequently they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mostly stay seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to place the sensing unit accordingly. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air therefore the greatest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
