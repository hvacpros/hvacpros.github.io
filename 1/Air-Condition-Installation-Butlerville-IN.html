He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
