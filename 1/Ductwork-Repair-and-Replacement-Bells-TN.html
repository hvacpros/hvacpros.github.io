(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys.
