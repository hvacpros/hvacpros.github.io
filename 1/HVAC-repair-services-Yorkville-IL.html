<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Yorkville IL</h3>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
