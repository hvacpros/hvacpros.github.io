Your heating and cooling contractor should evaluate and, if essential, update the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some health effects might appear soon after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a contaminant. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and typically short-term.

Not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be worsened or gotten worse.<p>
