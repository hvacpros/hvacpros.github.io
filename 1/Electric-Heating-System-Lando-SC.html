<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to houses. In truth, numerous office buildings have substantial air pollution sources A few of these buildings might be inadequately aerated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or run to supply appropriate quantities of outdoor air. Lastly, individuals normally have less control over the indoor environment in their offices than they carry out in their houses. As a result, there has been a boost in the occurrence of reported illness.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
