<p>The primary health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
