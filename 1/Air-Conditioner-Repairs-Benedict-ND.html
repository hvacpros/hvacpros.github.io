Consult your state health or housing department for ideas on which private laboratories or public companies may be able to help check your house for lead in paint. Home test packages can not discover small amounts of lead under some conditions. Work with an individual with special training for correcting lead paint problems to get rid of lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnant females, must leave the structure until all work is finished and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work.

<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.) In addition, homeowners must be alert to the introduction of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps need to not be carried out till these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradespersons.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
