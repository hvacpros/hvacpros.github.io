He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
