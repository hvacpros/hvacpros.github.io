<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
