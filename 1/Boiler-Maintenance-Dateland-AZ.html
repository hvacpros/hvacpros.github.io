<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
