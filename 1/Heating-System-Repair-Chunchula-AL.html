We have actually had a lot of firsts over the years, but this custom task presented unique challenges for our engineers," said a representative for Dometic.

<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have numerous control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
