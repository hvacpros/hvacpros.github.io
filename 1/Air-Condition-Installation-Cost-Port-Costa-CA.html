<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run since it simply takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a possibility to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
