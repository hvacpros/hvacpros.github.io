<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
