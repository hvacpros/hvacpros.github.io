Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the essential electrical improvements to save on cost.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
