Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation service entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
