<h3>HVAC Technician in Plainfield IA</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Numerous HVAC entrepreneur do not recognize they need different pricing schemes for different services that their company offers.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
