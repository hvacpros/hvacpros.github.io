<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
