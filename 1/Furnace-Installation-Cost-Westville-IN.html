<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
