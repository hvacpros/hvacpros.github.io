<p>Consumer products which contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is transformed to carbon monoxide gas in the body and can cause signs associated with direct exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly read the labels including health hazard information and warns on the proper use of these items.

<p>Immediate results may appear after a single exposure or duplicated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Unclean Filters: â $ " Â Filters clogged with dust, pet hair and other debris cause problems like failure to provide appropriate heat, excess noise and the furnace running all the time. If you discover the problem and have a washable filter, thereâ $ s no charge. DIY filter replacement alternatives range from $3 to $40, and you get what you pay for. That might be a very pricey dirty-filter medical diagnosis if the technician comes to your house. This type of cleaning work ought to be performed in a routine basis, so a furnace tune-up is required, inspect our Furnace Tune-Up Cost Guide to see its cost.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
