<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
