HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new.

<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
