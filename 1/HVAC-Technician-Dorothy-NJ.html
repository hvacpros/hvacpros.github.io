<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
