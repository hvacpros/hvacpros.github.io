<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractors in Santa Clara</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
