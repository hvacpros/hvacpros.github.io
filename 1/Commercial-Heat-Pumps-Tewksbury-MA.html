<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
