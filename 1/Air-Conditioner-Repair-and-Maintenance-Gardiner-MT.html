<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain.
