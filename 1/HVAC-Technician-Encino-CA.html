This step is essential so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the exact same period. Basically, SEER offers more information based upon how the EER carries out in different temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
