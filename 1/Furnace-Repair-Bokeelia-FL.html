<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
