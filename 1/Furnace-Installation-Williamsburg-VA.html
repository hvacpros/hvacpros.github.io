<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
