<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for decades, until the mandate for high-efficiency systems required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under numerous owners. Goodrich's dad was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
