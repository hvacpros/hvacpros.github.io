<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
