<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
