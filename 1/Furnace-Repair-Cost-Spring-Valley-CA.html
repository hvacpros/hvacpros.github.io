<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
