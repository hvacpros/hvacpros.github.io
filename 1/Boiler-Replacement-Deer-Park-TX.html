<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
