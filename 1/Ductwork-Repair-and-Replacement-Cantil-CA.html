They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My other half said that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have met in a long period of time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we require to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
