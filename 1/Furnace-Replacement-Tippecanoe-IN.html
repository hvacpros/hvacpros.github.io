<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood items used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins.

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe moldy or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>

To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
