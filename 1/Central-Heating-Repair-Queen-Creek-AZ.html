<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing combines quality products and impressive service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance cooling and heating products around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
