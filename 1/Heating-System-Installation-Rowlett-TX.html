<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources might not pose a considerable health risk on their own, a lot of houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a severe threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that most people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to prevent new problems from happening.

Electric heating systems begin at $395 and vary approximately $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>

Indications that can indicate your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy.
