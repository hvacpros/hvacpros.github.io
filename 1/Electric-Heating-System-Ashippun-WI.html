<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold.

<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
