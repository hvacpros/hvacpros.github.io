<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
