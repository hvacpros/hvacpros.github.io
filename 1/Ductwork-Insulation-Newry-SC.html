<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Newry SC</h3>
<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
