<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
