<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>

<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Kurtz IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
