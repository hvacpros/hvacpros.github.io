<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered.

Nevertheless, some makers require routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality issue is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated problems-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies listed below may be suitable.<p>
