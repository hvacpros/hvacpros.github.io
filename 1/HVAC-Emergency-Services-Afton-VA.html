<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead. Children might have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and correct air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician examine the system periodically.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Only a professional can properly detect why your furnace isn't starting. It's time to call an expert if at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something appears strange or you lose self-confidence. Similarly, if the procedure doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you need a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you find you need to do it regularly, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
