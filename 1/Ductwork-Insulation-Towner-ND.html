To make sure the system you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation estimate to figure out the exact type of heat and cooling system that's just right for your home-we do not just replace it with the very same size unit you presently have.

This action is essential so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
