<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the home. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health results varies significantly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those with no known health effect. Similar to other contaminants, the level and nature of the health impact will depend upon lots of aspects consisting of level of exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory problems are among the immediate symptoms that some people have actually experienced not long after direct exposure to some organics. At present, not much is learnt about what health effects take place from the levels of organics normally found in houses. Many natural substances are known to trigger cancer in animals; some are suspected of triggering, or are understood to cause, cancer in humans.<p>
