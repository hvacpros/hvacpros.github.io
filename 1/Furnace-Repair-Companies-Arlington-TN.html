<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral in the future).

If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
