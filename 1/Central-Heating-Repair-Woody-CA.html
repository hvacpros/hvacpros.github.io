<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Woody CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
