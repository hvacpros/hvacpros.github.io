<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its duct system; this cooled outside air needs to be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.<p>
