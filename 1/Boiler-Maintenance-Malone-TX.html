<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor at Malone TX</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
