<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

<p>Some diseases, like humidifier fever, are connected with exposure to toxic substances from microbes that can grow in big structure ventilation systems. However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that grow in house heating and cooling humidifiers and systems. Kids, elderly people, and individuals with breathing problems, allergies, and lung illness are particularly susceptible to disease-causing biological representatives in the indoor air.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
