When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
