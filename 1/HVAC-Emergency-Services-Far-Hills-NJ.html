<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Similar information is not offered for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of contaminants as is the case for IAQ issues.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
