<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

For many temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having a super high ranked heater is not always essential.<p>
