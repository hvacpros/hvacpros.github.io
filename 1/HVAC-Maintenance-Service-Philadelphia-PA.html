<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the building (e.g., office equipment; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might trigger thousands of nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
