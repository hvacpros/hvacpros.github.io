<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c unit are more energy effective than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your system if it's five years old or older.
