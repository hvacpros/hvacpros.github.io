<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
