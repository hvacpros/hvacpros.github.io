<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, given that the system is combined.
