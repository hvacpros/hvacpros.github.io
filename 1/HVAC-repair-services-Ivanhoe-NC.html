Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step.
