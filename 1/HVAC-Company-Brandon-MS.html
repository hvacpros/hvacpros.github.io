<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
