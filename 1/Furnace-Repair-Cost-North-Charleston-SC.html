Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
