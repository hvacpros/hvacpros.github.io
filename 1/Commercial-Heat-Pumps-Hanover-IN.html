<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. Since they only partly eliminate the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon entering the house, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy means of reducing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, provides further information on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air pollutants.<p>
