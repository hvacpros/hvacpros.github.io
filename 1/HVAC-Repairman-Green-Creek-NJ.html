<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary environmental risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and many other items.<p>

<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
