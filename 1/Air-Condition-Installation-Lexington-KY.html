<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each room.
