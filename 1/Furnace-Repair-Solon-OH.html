<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts.
