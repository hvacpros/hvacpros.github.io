<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
