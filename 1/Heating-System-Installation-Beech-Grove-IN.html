<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

From there you can take the proper action to solve the scenario right away.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
