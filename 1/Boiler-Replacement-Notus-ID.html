<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many common building products used before 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the elimination procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently advised instead.<p>

The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
