<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
