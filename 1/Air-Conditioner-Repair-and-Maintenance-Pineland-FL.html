<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
