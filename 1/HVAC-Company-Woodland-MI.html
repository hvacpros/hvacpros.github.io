<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Ensure all the registers in your house are large open.

If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
