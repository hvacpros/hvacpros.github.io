<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the house.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down totally.

As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
