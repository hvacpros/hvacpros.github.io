<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Clermont KY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow.

In addition, the big increases in ventilation it takes to considerably reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially. Subsequently, the most effective method to reduce exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking there.<p>
