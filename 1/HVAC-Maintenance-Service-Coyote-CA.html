<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Coyote CA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's important that it's sized correctly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the amount of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your house will not be heated up properly and the system will need to continuously run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating costs.<p>
