<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>

<p>The primary health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
