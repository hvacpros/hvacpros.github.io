The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
