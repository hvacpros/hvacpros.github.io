<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
<h3>HVAC Installation Near Me in Shady Dale GA</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Shady Dale GA</h3>
<p>By constantly developing new ideas, Hutchinson can reveal you how to minimize your air heating, conditioning, and cooling costs. As best heating and AC contractors, we can examine if your present a/c unit or heater fits your requirements or if a much better solution exists. We can likewise provide tune-ups for your air conditioning unit or heater to improve performance and extend its beneficial life.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
