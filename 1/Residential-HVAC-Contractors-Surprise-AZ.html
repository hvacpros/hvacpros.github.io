<h3>Portable Air Conditioner in Surprise AZ</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures drop and reach below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
