<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Peoria AZ</h3>
<p>Ductless air conditioning is, naturally, ideal for houses without ducts, however is also a flexible option for a range of other circumstances. Instead of pushing cool air through shafts in walls, attic and floor, ductless systems flow air straight to particular rooms. Really cost-efficient, and energy-efficient, and supplying greater control over when and where the air enters your home, All Points Heating can help you pick the very best ductless cooling system for your needs.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
