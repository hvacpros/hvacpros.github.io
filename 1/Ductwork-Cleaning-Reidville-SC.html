<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
