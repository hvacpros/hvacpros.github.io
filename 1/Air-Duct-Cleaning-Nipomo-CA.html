<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan ought to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins but the fan doesn't. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then see and repower the system if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
