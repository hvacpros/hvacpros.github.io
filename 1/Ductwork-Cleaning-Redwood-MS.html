<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
