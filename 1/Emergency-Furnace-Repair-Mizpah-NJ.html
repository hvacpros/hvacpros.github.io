<p>Since the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues.

First, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
