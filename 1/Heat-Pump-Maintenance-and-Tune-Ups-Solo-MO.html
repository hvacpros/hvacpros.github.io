<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
