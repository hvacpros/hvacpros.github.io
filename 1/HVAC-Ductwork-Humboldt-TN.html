<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Humboldt TN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>Furnace Replacement in Humboldt TN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed extremely quickly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
