<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
