<p>Considering that the 1980s, makers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system performance can likewise help increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually enforced tighter constraints for many years. There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs.

This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
