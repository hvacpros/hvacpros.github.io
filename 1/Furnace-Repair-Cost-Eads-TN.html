Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact.
