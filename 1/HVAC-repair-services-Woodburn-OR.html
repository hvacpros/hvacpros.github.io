<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without can be found in contact with the real flame or burner area.
