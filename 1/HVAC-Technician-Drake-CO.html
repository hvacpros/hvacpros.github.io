<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 must not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
