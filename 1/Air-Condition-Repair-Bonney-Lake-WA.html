<p>How climate change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
