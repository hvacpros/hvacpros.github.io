Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided a/c unit depend on a set of pipelines to connect the outside to the inside air system which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split ac system installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to produce either heated or cold air.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
