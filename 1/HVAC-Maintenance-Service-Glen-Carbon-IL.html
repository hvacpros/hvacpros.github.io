<p>I'll start with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most typical heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are ranked for performance.

If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
