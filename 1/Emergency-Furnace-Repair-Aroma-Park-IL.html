<p>Biological pollutants: the biological pollutants can consist of germs, infections, fungi (mold), allergen irritant, animal dander, insect bio fragments, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach allergen, and so on. and might arise from insufficient maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the structure by residents, infiltration, or ventilation air.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Secondly like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
