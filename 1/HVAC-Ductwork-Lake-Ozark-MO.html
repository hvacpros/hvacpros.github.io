<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
