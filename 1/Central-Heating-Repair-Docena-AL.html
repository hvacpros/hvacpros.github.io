<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater appears less like a luxury product and more like a requirement.
