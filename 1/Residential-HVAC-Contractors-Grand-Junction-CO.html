<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on price. It's tough to discover a truthful AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
