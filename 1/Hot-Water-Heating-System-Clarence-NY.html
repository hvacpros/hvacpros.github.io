<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Merely adding refrigerant is not an option if it leakages.

Keep in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
