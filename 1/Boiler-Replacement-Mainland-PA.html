<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise innovation. Martin said the company can develop a dashboard within the structure's controls that will offer data on its systems to allow for real time exposure, offering the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be provided to any commercial client, not simply throughout new building.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
