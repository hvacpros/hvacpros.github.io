<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are available to devices installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Climate Pro is trusted and really appreciated us and our circumstance. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could search for and buy it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to help us right before a vacation, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
