<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
