The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up.
