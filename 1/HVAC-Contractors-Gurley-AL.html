At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
