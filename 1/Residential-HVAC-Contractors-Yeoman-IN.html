<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
