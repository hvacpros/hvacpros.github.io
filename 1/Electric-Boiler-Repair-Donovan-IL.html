<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item.

Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
