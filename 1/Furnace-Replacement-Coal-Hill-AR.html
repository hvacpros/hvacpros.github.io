<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
