<h3>Ductless AC System in Johannesburg CA</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still does not work effectively after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
