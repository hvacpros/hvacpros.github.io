<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>

<h3>HVAC repair services in Ottsville PA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
