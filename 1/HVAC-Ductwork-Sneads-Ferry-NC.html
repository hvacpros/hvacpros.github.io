<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it establishes cracks which leakage, they require to be repaired. Having faulty ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your house will not be properly cooled, and your energy expenses will go up.

<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the floors, ceilings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers.
