<p>Typically the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater, consider possible results of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly guidelines on the correct fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
