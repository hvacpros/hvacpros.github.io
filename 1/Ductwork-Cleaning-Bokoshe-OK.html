<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they seem due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
