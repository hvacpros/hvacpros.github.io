<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
