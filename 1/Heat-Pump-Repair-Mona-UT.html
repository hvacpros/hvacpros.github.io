<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
