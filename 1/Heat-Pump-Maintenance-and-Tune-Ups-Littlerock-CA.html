<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same.

Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom flooring.<p>
