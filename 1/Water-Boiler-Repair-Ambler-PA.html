Such info can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative need to request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information may determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs.
