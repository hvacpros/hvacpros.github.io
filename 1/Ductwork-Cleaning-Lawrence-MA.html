<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, walls, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
