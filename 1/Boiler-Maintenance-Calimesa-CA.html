<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and stripping (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the pollutant source far from residents and even moving vulnerable residents.<p>

Atmospheric pressure distinctions produced by these forces move airborne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the within pressure amounts to the outside.<p>

<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Calimesa CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
