<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Haddonfield NJ</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
