Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
