<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, houses and schools matters, especially because we invest most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be set up to offer threshold alerts.
