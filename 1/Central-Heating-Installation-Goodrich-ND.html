<p>A customized air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioning unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
