Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

The HVAC system may be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread out these pollutants throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread out contaminants from one part of the home to another. Regular maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these problems.<p>
