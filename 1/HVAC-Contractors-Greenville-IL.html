The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
