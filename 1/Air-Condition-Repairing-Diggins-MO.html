Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
