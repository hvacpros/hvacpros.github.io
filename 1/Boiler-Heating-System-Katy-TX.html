<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Katy TX</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
