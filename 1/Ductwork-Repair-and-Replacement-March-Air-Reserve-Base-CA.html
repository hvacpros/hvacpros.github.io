<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã Many heating systems have multiple control panel. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnÃ¢ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonÃ¢ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. ItÃ¢ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
