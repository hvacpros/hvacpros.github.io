<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Brazil IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
