<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
