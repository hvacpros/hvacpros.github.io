<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
