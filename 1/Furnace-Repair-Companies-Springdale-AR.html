<h3>Hints to Help You Hire Springdale AR Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>A split a/c system might cost close to that of a standard HVAC system however has shown to be an alternative cost efficient option to homes that do not have ductwork. Used along with other kinds of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioners, space heating systems, or oil heating units, it can improve the comfort of your home while keeping your monthly energy costs affordable.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
