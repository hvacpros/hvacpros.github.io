<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older houses may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchen areas and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency system. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
