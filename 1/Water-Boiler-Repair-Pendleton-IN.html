<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE firm, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years prior to that.<p>
