<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen.

We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
