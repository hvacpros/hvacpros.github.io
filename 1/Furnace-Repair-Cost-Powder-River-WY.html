A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
