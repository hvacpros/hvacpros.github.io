<p>I am changing our High Velocity System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Since it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate results that are frequently mistaken for the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, disorientation and tiredness. The results of CO direct exposure can vary significantly from individual to person depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
