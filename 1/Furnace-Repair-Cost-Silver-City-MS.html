<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

It may also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific spaces.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and fridges used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
