<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
