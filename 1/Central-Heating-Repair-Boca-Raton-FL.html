<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Another pollutant of indoor air is outdoor air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, individuals with asthma may discover being inside provides the very best relief, if the indoor air environment is good. Although cooling does not filter the air, it assists people with asthma since windows and doors are kept shut, which helps keep pollens and other outside irritants and irritants out of the house. An unexpected shift in temperature from warm to cold can also an asthma attack.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which instantly closed down the heatpump if temperatures reach and drop below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
