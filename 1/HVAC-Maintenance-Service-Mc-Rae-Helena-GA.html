Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

That's the last thing you want because you will need to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is fixed.
