<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of houses.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
