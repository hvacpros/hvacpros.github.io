<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Pierson FL</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good possibility; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on rare celebrations.<p>
