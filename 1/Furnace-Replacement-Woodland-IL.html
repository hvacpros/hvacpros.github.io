<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical.

<p>Airflow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions created by these forces move air-borne pollutants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
