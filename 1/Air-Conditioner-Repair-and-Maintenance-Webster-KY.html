<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand.

<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin.
