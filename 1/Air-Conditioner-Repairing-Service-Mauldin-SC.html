<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building."

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
