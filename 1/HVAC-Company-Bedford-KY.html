This is not to state that there aren't standards for levels of CO and NO2; lots of bodies have set standards and standards for both In the United States, the EPA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have set CO guidelines, however the EPA's standards only use to outdoor air.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
