<h3>Everything You Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
