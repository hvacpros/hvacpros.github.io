<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
