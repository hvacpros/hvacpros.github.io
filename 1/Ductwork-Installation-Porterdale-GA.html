<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
