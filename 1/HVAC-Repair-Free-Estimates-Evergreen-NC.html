<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
