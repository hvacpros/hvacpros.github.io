<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle.

Not only are heatpump practical, they are extremely energy efficient, too. The best time to set up air conditioning in your house might really well be when your heating system breaks down if a heat pump is in your future.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a better solution.
