<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
