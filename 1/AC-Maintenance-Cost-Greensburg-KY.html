<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Building and Commissioning is created for architects, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of building materials, smoking, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units.

<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems.
