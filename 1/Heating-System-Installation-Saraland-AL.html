<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Role in Saraland AL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We want we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
