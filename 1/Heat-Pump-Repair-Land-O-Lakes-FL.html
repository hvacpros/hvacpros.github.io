<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later).

The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure.
