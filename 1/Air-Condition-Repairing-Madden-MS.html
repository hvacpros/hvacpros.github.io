<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done.

I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
