<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outside system.
