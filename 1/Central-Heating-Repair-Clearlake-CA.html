<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
