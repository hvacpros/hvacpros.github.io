<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
