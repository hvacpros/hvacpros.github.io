<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been effectively dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
