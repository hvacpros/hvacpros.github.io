If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
