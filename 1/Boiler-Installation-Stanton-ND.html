<p>Some illness, like humidifier fever, are associated with direct exposure to toxins from microorganisms that can grow in big building ventilation systems. However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that grow in house heating and cooling humidifiers and systems. Children, senior people, and individuals with breathing issues, allergic reactions, and lung illness are particularly prone to disease-causing biological agents in the indoor air.<p>
<p>A customized air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioning unit transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the very same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
