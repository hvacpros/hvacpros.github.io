Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house again. What's most incredible was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week!

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Service in Ellenwood GA</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer guidance to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
