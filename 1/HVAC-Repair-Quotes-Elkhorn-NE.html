<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
