<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
