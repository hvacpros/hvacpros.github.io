<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
