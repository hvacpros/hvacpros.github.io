<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
