<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
