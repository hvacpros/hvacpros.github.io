We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a house owner can take to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of if it becomes damp.<p>
