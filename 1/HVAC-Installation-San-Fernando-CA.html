<p>There are numerous actions a house owner can take to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from taking place - a number of them are pointed out here. First, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, consider using solid wood products. Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
