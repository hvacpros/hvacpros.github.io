<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
