The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
