Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
