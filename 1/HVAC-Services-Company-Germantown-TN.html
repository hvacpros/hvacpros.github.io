<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a straightforward and effective  approach to decrease ambient air contamination and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
