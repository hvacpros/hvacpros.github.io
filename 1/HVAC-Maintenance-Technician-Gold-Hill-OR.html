<p>Furnaces resemble vehicles. As they age, you can replace one part only need another part changed or fixed next year. It does not take long to spend $500 simply to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Heaters sustain the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
