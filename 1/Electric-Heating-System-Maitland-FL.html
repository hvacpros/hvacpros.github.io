<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
