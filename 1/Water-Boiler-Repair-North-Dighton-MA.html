<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to deadly accidents when they leaked.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
