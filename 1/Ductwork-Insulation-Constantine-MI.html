<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different approaches. The CMHC study contacted a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a study, and the researchers did not control for time spent or techniques used.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
