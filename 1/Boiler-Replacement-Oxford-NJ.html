<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing.
