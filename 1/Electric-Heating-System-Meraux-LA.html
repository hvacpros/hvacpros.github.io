<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
