<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
