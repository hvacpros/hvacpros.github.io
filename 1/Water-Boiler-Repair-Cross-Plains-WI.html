<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>Passive Ventilation in Cross Plains WI</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>For contaminants aside from radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or indications of bad ventilation and particular sources or toxins have been determined as possible causes of indoor air quality issues. Evaluating for many contaminants can be expensive. Prior to monitoring your home for pollutants besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals who have experience in solving indoor air quality issues in nonindustrial structures.<p>
<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
