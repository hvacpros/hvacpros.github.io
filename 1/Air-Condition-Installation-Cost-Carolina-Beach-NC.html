<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Around The Clock Cooling is as guaranteed: offered right away to provide excellent service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works nicely and effectively to deliver a completed project in record time.
