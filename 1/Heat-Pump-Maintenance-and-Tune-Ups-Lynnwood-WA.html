This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or just a high level of competition for experienced trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest average incomes for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
