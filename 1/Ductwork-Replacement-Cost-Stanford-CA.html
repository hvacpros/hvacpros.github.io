Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking cigarettes, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters.

<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
