<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
