<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
