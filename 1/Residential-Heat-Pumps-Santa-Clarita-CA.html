<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
