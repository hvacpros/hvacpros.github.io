<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
