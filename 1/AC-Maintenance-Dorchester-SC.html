<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure tenancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
