Pressed wood items made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
