<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and harden-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
