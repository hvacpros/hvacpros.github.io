<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on regularly might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
