<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
