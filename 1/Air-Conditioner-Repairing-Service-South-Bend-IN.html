Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week!

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>

<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in South Bend IN</h3>
