<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
