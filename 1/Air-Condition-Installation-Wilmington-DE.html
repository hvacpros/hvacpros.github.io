<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
