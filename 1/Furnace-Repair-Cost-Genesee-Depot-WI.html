<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
