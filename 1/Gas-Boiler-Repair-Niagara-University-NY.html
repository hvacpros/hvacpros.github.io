<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00.

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power.

Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still does not work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
