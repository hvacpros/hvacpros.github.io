<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
