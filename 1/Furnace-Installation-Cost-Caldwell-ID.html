<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>

<p>Usually the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you before you are aware it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are frequently incorrect for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, disorientation, fatigue and queasiness. The results of CO exposure can vary considerably from person to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
