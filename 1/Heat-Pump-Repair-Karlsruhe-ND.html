<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Karlsruhe ND?</h3>

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
