<p>New air conditioning unit generally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER ranking suggests higher energy performance and possibly lower energy bills. A good SEER rating for you depends on your house size, where you live and other factors.

<p>Some health impacts might show up quickly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a toxin. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Right after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may appear, be worsened or gotten worse.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as an automobile radiator or normal household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources might not posture a substantial health danger on their own, many homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious threat from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that most people can take both to minimize the threat from existing sources and to prevent new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
