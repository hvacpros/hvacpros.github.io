<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Kelso TN</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the professionals thought they simply didn't seem right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
