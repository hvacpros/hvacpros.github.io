<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on uncommon occasions.<p>
