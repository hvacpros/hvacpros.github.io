<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, much of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Depending on the kind of unit installed, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly adverse dust.

Throughout use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the home.<p>
