<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal.
