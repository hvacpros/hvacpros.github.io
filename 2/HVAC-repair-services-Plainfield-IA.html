<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
