<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
