<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
