<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
