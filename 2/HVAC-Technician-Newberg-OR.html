"Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up.
