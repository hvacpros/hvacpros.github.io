Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
