<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are great for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, because the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
