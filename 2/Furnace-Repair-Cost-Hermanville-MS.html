<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
