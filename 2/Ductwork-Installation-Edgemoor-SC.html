<h3>The Way to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Edgemoor SC</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We decided on getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
