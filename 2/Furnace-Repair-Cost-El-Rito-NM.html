<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
