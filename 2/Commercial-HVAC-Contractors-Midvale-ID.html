To ensure the unit you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the exact type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply replace it with the exact same size system you presently have.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
