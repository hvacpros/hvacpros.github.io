<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
