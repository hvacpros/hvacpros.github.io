The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
