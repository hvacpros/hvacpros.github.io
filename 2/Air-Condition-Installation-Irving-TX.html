<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
