<p>A geothermal heating unit does not produce its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, oil, or gas. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses substantially less electrical power compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an appealing solution to cut your carbon footprint, offering a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
