<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Ardmore AL</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house building is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
