When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to stress over a thing.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by human beings, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
