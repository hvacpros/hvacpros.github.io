<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly.
