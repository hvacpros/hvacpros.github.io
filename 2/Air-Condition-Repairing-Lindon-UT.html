Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and located methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these small but substantial adjustments in his bid. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump due to the fact that of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental reasons.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
