<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
