HVAC specialists recommend following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
