<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Moraga CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
