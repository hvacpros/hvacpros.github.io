<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
