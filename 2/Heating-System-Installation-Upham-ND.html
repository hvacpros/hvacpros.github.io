<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
