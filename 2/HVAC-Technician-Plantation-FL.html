<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
