<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
