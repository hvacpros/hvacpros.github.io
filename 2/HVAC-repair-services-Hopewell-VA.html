<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the service technicians believed they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
