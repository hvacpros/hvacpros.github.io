<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
