If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern.

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
