<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these home appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants.
