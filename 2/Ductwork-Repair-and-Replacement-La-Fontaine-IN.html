<h3>Furnace Replacement in La Fontaine IN</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
