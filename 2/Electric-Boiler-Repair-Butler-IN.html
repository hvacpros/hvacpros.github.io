While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
