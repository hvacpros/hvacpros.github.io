For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools required to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician examine the system regularly.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, especially if you live in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air.

The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Checking and changing the air filters is among the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
