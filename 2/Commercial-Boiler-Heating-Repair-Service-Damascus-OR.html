<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
