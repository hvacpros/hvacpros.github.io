Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation business totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
