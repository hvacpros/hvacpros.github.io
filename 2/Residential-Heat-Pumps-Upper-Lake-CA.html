<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
