<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
