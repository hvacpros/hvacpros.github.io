<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
