<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company in Hurst TX</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
