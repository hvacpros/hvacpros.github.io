<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your cooling system from flooding. Among the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have actually seen baseplate spoil on unusual occasions.<p>
