<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not just will obstructed vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumber discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was amazing, useful and informative - his work was remarkable!

We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and Cooling for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
