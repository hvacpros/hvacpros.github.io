All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he assisted me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a truthful AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
