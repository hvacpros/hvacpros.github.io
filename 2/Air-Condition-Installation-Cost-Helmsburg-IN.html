<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
