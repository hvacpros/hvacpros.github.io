Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the service technicians believed they simply didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
