<p>If no pollutant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stale air may also be an issue.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down quickly. This is an extremely typical repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
