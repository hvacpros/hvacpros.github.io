Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
