<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not toxic, but might become dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Bacteria or micro-organisms may also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread out throughout the entire office or building by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
