<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Valley Ford CA</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
