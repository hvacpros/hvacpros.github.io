<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers need to attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
