<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
