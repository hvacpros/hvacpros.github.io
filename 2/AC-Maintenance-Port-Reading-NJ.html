<p>The exhaust outlets enable all hazardous gases to escape your property so there's no risky buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are blocked, they can result in an unsafe accumulation and compromise your safety. The technician will evaluate all of these elements of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack also. They will try to find indications of rust, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
