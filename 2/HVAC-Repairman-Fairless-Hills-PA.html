<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% performance, this can mean substantial cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Air ducts are accountable for distributing cold and hot air throughout your home, offering a comfortable climate in every room. But ducts that are not set up appropriately or preserved can disperse contaminants from one space to another. Gradually, dust, dander and even mold can accumulate in your ducts, decreasing the general air quality. Employ a professional to ensure your ducts are distributing fresh, clean air.<p>
