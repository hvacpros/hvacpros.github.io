<p>You're motivating the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of germs and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
