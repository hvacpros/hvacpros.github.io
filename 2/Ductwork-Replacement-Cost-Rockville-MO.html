<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor.
