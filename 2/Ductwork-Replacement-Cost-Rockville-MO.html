<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can shut and get too hot down. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power.

Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs.
