<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of building materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in manufactured items. For instance, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as a part of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and covering products.<p>
