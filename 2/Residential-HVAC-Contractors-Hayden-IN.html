<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing early deterioration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the part.. a really helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
