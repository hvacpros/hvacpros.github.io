<p>A third way to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities.

Signs that can suggest your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
