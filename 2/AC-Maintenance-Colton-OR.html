<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Colton OR</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
