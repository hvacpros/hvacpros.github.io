<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period.

The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
