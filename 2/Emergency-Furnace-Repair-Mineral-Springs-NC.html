<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair at Mineral Springs NC</h3>
<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once removing waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to eliminate them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it increasingly tough for your lungs to work appropriately, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
