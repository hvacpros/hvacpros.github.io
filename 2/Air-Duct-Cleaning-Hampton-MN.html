<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system periodically.<p>
