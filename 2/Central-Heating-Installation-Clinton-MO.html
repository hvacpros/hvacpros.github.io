<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A/c makers generally make rugged, high quality items. If your a/c stops working, start by examining any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the unit cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers.
