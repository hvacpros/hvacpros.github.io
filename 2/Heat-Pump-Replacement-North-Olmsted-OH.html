As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
