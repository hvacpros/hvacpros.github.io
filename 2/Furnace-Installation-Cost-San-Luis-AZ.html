<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized.

<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
