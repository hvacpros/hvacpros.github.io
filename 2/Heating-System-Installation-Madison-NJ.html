<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window.

Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved issues. I would advise this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
