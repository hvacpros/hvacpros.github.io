Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
