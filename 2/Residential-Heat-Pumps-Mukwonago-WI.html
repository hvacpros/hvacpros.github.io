<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
