<h3>Commercial HVAC in Redmond WA</h3>
<p>Today's home convected heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom floor or be set up throughout the whole sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
