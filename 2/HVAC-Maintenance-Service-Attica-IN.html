<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floors, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon ends up being caught in buildings and concentrations build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and building occupants might be exposed to a range of impurities (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction activities, home furnishings and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outdoor pollutants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
