<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Due to the fact that it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
