<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings, and home items like air fresheners, release contaminants more or less constantly. Other sources, related to activities carried out in the house, release toxins periodically. These include smoking cigarettes, making use of malfunction-ing or unvented stoves, heaters, or area heating systems, the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, making use of paint strippers in remodeling activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in housekeeping. High contaminant concentrations can stay in the air for extended periods after some of these activities.<p>
