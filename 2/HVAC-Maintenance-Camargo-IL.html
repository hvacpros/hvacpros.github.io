<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of unusual being that package was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would advise this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a regular oil change in your car. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
