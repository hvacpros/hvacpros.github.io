<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in homes. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the house. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heatpump operate on electrical power and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating unit) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
