<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Many AC units feature a number of unique features that can even more enhance performance and performance. For instance, house owners may wish to search for one that comes with a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter requires to be altered.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
