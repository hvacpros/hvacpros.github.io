We may find it helpful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
