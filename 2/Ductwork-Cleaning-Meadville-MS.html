<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
