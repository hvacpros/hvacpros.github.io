<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the concern. He is truthful, reliable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
