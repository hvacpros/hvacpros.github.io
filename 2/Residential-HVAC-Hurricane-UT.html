From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some basic maintenance.

The sluggish rebound in commercial and residential building and construction will produce a stable flow of new opportunities, specifically for technicians who are willing to move.
