<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>A lot of well and city water does not typically include lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the home from home plumbing that is made with lead products.

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage.
