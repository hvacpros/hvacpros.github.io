He knew just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
