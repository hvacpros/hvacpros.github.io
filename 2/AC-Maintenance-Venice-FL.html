<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Venice FL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
