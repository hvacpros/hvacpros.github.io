<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
