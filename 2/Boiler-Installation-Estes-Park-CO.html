<h3>How to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Estes Park CO</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
