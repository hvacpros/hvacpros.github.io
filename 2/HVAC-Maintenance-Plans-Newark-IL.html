<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
