<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Since as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>

<p>HVAC coils generally give you a great 15-20 years of life before they start developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leaks aren't the only problem cooling coils have. Coils, after many years, lose the capability to move heat correctly.

When your HVAC coil starts to rot, your air conditioning unit will have to work harder.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
