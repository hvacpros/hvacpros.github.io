<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
