The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level.

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
