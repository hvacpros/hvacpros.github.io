<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
