<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
