You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

When the copper or aluminum coils start to rust, refrigerant leakages occur.<p>
