<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers.
