<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.
