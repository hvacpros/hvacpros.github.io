The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

The outdoor unit should also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently discharged outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically.
