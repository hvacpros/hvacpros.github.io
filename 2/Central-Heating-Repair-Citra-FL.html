<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My better half stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent people I have fulfilled in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us.
