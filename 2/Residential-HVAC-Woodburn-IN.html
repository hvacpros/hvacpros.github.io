<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was extraordinary, helpful and practical - his work was impressive! All of his assistants were diligent and courteous. The work website was left entirely cleared and cleaned. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered exceptional, personalized, mindful, and quality service. His communication style gets along, effective and engaging. He plainly and completely described all issues and fixes in a way that made me positive in his ability to solve my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a needed part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to withstand another night without heat, throughout among the coldest winters in recent memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to an issue that couldn't be dealt with on the first check out due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to deliver consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
