<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
