<p>UW trainees, employees and visitors must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and carry out numerous activities. If the air quality is poor it can affect a person's convenience, health, and productivity.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and preserve healthy and comfortable environments free of impurities. A crucial part of the program is responding to and resolving issues of building occupants about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we offer guidance to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is new and still under a manufacturer's warranty. Any significant repairs ought to be covered under the producer's warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
