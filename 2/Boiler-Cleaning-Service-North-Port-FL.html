<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
