<p>Since a task such as this is going to need a rather comprehensive amount of work it is recommended that a homeowner demand numerous estimates from a variety of contractors. The best times of the year to do such a task remain in the months in which homes are not using their heater.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
