<h3>Heating Service in Glencoe IL</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The repayment for a system can vary from 2-10 years, while the life time of a system can be 18-23 years, almost double a conventional system.
