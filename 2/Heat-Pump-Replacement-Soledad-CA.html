<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have.
