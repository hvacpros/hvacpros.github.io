Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Switch off the power. Flip the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
