<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Livingston LA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
