<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
