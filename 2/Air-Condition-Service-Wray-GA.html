<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has actually been used typically in a range of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant. EPA and CPSC have prohibited several asbestos items. Producers have also voluntarily restricted usages of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most frequently found in older houses, in pipe and furnace insulation products, asbestos shingles, millboard, textured paints and other finishing materials, and floor tiles.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE scores often come with higher price tags. So, make sure to decide based upon how often you will utilize your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year. For many temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter, having an incredibly high ranked heating system is not always essential.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor must run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you have actually given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
