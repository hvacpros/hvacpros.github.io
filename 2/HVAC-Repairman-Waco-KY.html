<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
