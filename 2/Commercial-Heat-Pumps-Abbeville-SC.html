<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Abbeville SC</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
