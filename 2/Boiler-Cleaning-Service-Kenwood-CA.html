<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which immediately closed down the heatpump if temperatures reach and drop listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Gas heaters do include some drawbacks. The greatest disadvantage is likewise the result of the combustion process. This process produces exhaust gases, including carbon monoxide gas, which have to be vented to the beyond the home. Carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, and is highly harmful in higher concentrations. A malfunctioning gas furnace or a venting issue might put your house's residents in genuine danger because of this.
