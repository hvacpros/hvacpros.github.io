<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, but it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
