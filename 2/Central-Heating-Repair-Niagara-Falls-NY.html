<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
