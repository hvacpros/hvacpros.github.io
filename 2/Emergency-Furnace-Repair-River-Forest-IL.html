<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might notice undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
