Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
