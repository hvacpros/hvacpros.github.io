<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>

<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future.
