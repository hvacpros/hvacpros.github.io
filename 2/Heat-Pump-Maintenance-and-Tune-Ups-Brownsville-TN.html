<h3>Gas Heating in Brownsville TN</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones got.
