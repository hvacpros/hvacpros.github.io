<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by the majority of public water products, it has been found in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief biking in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will just run harder to preserve a warm climate for your house when the weather condition is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our service technicians if you require clarity on this concern.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold growth.<p>
