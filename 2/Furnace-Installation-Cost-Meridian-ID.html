<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
