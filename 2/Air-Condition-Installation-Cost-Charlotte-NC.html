<h3>Ductwork Replacement Cost in Charlotte NC</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
