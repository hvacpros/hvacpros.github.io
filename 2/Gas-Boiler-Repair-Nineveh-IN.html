<p>Since an ac system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
