Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>These guys have been fantastic. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to provide me an opinion for what work on a home might cost. Just recently I required to call on these men two times. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You men are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you need to do it often, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
