<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied excellent customer service at the end of the appointment by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may want to have carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>The main reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the quantity of services used. The cost might not be beneficial if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>As discussed above, activating your new under tile floor heating unit prematurely, before the mortar has actually treated, can cause the grout to split or to not adhere effectively, and might void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the substance had actually treated. And mortar manufacturers may refuse warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
