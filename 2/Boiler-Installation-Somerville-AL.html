<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, however they had to order it. My wife stated that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most good people I have fulfilled in a long time.
