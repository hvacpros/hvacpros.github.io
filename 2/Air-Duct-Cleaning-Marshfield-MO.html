<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
