<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air toxins. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.
