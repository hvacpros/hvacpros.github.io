<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
