<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
