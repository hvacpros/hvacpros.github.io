<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

Prior to inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
