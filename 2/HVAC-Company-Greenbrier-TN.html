Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it progressively difficult for your lungs to operate correctly, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
