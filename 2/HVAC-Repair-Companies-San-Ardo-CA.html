<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.

Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
