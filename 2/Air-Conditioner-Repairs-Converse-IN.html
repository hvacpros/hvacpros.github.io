<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are numerous other toxins that can not only dirty up the air, however lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin resulting from gas that escapes into your home without being burnt. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are generally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
