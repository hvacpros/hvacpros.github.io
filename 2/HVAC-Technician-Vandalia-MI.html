<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
