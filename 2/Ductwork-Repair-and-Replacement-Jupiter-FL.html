<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are dealt with in a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a threat just. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for significant health problems.<p>
