<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an excellent task in making sure we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The service technicians who set up the brand-new system were fast and professional, while taking time to ensure we comprehended how the new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
