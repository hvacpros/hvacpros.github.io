<p>To be honest, few of the centers managers who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us for that reason. Usually they were initially thinking about from another location monitoring some other element of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they learnt more about and executed indoor air quality monitoring to provide a healthier, safer building environment-- and to avoid the negative consequences related to indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
