<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have dealt with the one repair I required well, and are professional and constantly on-time.

<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the released spores.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
