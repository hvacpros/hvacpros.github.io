<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be using them again.<p>
