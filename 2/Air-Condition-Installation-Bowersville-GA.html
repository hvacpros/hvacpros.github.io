<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior.
