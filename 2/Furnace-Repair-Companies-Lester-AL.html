<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
