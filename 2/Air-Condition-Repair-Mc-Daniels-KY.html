<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978.

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
