<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
