It sounds unbelievable, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.
