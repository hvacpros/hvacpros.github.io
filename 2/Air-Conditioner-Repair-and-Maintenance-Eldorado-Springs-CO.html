<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
