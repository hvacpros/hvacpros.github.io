<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
