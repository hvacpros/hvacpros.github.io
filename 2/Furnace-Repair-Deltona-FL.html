<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
