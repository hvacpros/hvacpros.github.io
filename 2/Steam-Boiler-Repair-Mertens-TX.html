<p>A specific a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat out of the space because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
