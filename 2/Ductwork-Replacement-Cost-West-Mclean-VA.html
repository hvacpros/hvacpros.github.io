<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heatpump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the model you acquire.

This indicates it can warm up your house to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
