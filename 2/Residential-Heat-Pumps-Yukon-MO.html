<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same period. Essentially, SEER offers more data based upon how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
