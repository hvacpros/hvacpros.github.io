<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
