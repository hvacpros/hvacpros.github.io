<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
