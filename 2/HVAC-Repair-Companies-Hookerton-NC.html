<p>We're Not Simply Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to look out for is the dust that gathers during summer seasons. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heater burners are checked and cleaned up completely before chillier seasons start.

<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful results of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
