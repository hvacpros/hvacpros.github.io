<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex problems-- determined by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques listed below might be suitable.<p>
