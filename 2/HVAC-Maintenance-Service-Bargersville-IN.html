<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
