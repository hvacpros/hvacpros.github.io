<h3>Air Condition Installation in Los Osos CA</h3>

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
