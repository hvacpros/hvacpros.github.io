<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
