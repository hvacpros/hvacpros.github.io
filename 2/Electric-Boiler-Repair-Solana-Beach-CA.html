<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
