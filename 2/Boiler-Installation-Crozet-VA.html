<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have actually satisfied in a very long time. We require to support the real people who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
