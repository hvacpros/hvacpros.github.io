<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, instead of outside or industrial settings.

It may likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>
