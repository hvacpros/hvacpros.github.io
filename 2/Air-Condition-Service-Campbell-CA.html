As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
