<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years ago and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
