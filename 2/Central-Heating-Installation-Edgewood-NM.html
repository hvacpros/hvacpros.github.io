<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Edgewood NM</h3>
<p>MAINTENANCE PLANS: Your HVAC system is an investment that pays for itself throughout the years, however just if you safeguard it to the best of your capability. Thankfully, this doesn't need to be a task! When you register for a Keefe's maintenance strategy, we look after whatever. No matter what make or model of cooling or heating system you own, even if it's a zone control system, you'll get semi-annual evaluations, discounted diagnostics, top priority service, and incredible deals on replacements and repairs. Pick in between our bronze, platinum, gold, and silver plans, and we'll provide you with the greatest level of protection and maintenance.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
