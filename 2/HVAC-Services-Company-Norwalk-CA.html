Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
