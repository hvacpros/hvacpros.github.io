<h3>HVAC Repair Quotes in Midnight MS</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
