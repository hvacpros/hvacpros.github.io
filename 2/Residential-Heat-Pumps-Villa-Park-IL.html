<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based on the most recent science for NO2.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely practical in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
