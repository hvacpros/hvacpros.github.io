<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
