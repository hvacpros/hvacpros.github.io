<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
