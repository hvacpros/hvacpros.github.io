<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
