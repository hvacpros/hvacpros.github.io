<p>A customized air conditioning system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. A standard a/c transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter can worsen issues. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it's important to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your surroundings.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
