Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.
