<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
