<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
