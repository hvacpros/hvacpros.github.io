<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
