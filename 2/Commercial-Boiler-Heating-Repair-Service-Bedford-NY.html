<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My spouse said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have fulfilled in a long time.
