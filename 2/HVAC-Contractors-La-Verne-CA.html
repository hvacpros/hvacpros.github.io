<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
