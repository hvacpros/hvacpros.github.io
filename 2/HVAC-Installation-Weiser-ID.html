<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Weiser ID</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
