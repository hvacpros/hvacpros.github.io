Buildings continuously evolve as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them as well as the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
