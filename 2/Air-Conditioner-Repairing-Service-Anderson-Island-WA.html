<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
