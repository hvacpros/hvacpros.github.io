<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
