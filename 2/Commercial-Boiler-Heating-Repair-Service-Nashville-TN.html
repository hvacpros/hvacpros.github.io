<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the variety of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to previously owned smoke causes eye, nose, and throat irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might see unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
