<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
