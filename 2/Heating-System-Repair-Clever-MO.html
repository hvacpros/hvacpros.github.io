This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
