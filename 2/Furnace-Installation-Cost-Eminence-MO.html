<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.

The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
