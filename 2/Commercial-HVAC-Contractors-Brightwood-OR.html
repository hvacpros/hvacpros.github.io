<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
