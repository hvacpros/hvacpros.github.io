<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
