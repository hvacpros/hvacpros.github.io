<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Geothermal air conditioning is a economical and smart way to cool off your house or business when the temperature levels keep climbing. However when your AC system quits working efficiently or begins to breakdown, you need an experienced contractor to come in and get it fixed as rapidly as possible. Which's where we can help.

Before we design and install any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Basic improvements generally include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend several qualified house Energy Star auditors and installation specialists. Please Contact United States for recommendations.<p>
