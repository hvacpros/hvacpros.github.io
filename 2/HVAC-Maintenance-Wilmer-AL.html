<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
