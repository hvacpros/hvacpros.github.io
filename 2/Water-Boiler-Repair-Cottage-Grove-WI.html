<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage. Since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>

<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Cottage Grove WI</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
