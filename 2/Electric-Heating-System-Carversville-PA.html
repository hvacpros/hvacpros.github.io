One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water usually gets lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead products.

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
