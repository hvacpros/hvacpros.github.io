One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then generates heat.<p>
