<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site.

I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
