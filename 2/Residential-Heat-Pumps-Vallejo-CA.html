<h3>Advantages of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Vallejo CA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
