<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, water pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergies.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, air and ventilation Conditioning, and describes the climate control systems installed in homes or commercial homes.
