<p>Filters can get filthy easily, particularly if you reside in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, germs, and clean the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and replaced regularly, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Examining and altering the air filters is one of the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>

While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
