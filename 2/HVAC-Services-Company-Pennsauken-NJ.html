<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many people assume pollution is simply an outdoor problem, your house (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the things we place in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right now, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that must be constantly provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation coupled with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be useful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>

<p>Filters can get unclean easily, specifically if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and changed frequently. The heating & cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and altering the air filters is among the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
