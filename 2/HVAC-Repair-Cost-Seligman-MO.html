<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical energy, a heat pump is a cost-effective option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>
