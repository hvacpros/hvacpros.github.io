<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal parts too.

At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
