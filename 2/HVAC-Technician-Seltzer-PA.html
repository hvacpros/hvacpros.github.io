A/c unit help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not attain a low humidity.

Incorrectly situated outside air consumption vents can also generate air infected with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
