<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners need to be alert to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps ought to not be undertaken till these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors.

This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
