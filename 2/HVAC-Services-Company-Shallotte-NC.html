<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will need more energy to cool your house.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
