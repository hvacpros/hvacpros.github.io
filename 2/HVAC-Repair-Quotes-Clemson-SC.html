<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
