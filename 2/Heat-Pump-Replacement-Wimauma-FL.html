<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's efficiency. To ensure the system is working effectively, think about having a routine coolant system flush.

<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size.

On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
