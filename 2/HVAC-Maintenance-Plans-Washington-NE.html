Heat can be removed through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is used either in a heatpump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a complimentary cooling system which utilizes pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (usually water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
