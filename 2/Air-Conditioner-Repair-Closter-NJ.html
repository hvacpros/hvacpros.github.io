<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
