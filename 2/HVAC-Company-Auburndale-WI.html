<p>Cooling and refrigeration are provided through the elimination of heat. Heat can be eliminated through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are referred to as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heatpump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a free cooling system which utilizes pumps to circulate a cool refrigerant (normally water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have been very delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked effectively and is so effective that it substantially decreased our utility costs - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergency situations they responded rapidly and solved the issue.<p>
