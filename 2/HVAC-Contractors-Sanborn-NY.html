<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon numerous elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
