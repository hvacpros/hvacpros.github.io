The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's directions.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
