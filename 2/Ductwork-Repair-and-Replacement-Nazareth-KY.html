They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
