<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly higher earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for competent trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average salaries for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
