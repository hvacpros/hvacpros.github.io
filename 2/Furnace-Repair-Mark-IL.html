<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
