<h3>Locating Best HVAC Contractors in Malmo NE</h3>
<p>After living in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must state it does the job rather well. It takes really little time to heat up or cool off the house which is one of the things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
