<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air may likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
