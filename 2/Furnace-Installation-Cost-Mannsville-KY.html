<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
