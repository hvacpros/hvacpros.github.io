<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
