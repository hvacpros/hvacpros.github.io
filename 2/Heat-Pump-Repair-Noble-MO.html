<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to offer threshold alerts. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your monitoring devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Watch out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in surprise or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
