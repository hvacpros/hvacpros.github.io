<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
