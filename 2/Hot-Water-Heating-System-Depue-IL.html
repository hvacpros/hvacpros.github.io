<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
