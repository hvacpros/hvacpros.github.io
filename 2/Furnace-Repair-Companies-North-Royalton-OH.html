One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist present, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
