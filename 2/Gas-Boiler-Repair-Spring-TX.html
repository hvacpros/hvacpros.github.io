<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible.
