<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside.
