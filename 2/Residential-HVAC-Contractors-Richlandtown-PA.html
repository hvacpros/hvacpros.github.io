The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
