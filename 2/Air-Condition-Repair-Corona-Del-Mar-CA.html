The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable resource section suggests that "Air Filtration should have a Minimum Performance Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to lower the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can minimize the performance of the coils.<p>

<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Function in Corona Del Mar CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
