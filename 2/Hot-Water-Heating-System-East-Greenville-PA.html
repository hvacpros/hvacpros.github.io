<h3>How to Select a Specialist HVAC Technician in East Greenville PA</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
