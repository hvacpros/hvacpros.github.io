<p>Unpredictable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
