<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators used harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>As with many home enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ commonly based on the size of the home. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner should think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house. A small house, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
