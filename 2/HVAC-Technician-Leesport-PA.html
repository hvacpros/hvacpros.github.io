<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which normally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
