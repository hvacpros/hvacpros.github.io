<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has failed. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
