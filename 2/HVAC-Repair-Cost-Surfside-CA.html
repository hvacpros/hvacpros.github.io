<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks.
