<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
