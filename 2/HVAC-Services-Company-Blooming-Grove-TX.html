Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, electrical power or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
