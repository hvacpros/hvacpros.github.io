<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make sure to have those dimensions on hand when looking for an a/c to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window. Likewise, keep fire safety in mind when choosing where to install the air conditioning unit: Do not place it in an egress window that works as the only methods of escape must a fire erupt.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify smells in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
