<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Mcchord Afb WA - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and trouble in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may set off attacks in individuals with asthma. There is evidence that some individuals can develop a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has actually also been revealed to trigger cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
