<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>A geothermal heater is more trustworthy than options, and is not affected by any external elements, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar power.

This makes geothermal heating a available and reputable  source of energy.<p>
