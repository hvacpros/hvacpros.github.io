<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair cost.

<h3>Installation of HVAC in Princeton NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or merely a high level of competition for proficient trades.

The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
