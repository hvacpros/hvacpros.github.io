<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
