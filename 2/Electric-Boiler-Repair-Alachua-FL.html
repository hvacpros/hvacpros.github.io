<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
