<p>Both must be kept clean since an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically crucial to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed.
