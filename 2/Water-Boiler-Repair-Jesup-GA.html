Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion procedure. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process.
