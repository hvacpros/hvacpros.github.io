<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center.

<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
