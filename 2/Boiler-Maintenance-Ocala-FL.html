<p>There are a lot of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating system. Radiant heating systems tend to be far more energy efficient than other heaters, for one thing. Required air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leaks, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.
