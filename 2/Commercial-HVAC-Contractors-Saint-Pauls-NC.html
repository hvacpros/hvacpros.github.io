<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate adequate quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can also generate air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to increase and stream out high structure openings to the outside (stack result ), triggering cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use really little energy, but care should be taken to ensure convenience. In warm or humid environments, preserving thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation may not be possible. Cooling systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when proper.<p>
