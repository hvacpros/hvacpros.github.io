<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
