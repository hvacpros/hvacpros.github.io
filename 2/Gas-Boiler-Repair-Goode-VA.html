The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future.

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short cycling in extremely winter. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will simply run more difficult to keep a warm climate for your home when the weather condition is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact one of our technicians if you require clearness on this concern.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
