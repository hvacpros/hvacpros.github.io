<p>A health survey need to be established and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool ought to recognize the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the signs take place (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; recognize all machines operated in the workplace; suggest the type of outside air contamination; and recognize possible sources of job tension.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
