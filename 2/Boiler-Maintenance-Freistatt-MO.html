<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of contaminated soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>House owners might also presume that since a glowing floor heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will right away raise their house's worth. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively impacts property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Publication. Perhaps Real estate agents should think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or subtract from, any given asking cost. That said, homebuyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
