<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Suitable Duct Sealing at Oak Ridge TN</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
