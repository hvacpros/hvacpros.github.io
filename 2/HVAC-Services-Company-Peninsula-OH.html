<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioning unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be enabled to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically basic to keep and understand.<p>
