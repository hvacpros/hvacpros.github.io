Need to you experience any of these, air out your house, open a window to the furnace space and instantly call a service technician.

<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window.
