To make certain the system you select is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load estimation quote to figure out the precise kind of heat and cooling system that's perfect for your home-we do not just replace it with the very same size unit you currently have. These calculations take into consideration things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
