<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Sallisaw OK Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single family homes, duplexes, mobile houses, apartment or condos, high-rise condominiums, row housing, etc.). No matter what the type of house HVAC system, appropriate air flow (ventilation), appropriate purification, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running safely and not adding to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
