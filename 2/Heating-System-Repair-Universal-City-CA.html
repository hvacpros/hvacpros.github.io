<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Universal City CA</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters.

For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
