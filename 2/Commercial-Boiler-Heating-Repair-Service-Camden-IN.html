<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, houses and schools matters, particularly since we spend most of our lives indoors. A/c unit assist to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
