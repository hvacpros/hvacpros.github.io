<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
