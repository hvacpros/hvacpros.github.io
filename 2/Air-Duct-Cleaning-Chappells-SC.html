Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
