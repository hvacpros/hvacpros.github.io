<p>Poor indoor air quality is typically triggered by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the primary issue in over half the workplace indoor air examinations it has carried out. Investigations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the very same to be true. These examinations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
