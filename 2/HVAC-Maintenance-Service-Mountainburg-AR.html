<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in costly repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which generally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>

And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
