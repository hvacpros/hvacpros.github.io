Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
