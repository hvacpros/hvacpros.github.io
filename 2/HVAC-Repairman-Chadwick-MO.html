<h3>Knowing the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at Chadwick MO</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require relatively little attention. But, as with any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems should be checked at least two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to remove dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
