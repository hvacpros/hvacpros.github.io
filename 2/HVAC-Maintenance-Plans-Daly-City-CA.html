<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
