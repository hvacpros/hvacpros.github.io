According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
