<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature level of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, lorries such as cars, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
