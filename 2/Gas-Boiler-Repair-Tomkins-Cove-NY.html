<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Tomkins Cove NY Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in top condition for the air conditioner to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
