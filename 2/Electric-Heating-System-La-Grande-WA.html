<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit, think about potential effects of indoor air pollution.
