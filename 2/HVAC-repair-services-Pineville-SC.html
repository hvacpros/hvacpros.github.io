<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise referred to as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heatpump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is generally more pricey than central air.<p>
