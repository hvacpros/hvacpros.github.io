Not only was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
