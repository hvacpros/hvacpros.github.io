Because they do not need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
