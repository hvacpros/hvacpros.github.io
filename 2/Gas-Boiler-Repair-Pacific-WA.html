<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outside air that must be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with appropriate usage of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
