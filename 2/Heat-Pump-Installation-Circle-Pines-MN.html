<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Circle Pines MN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
