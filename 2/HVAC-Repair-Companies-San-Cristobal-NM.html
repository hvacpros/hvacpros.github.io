<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new construction (homes usually use between one and five heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
