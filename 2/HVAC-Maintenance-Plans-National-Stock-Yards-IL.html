<h3>Residential Heat Pumps in National Stock Yards IL</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

It also doesn't develop any drafts, and removing the need to blow air makes it more energy efficient.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
