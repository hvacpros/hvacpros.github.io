<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioners) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
