<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
