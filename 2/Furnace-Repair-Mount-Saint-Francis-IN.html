<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
