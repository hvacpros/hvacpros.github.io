<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using All the time. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these gadgets).

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
