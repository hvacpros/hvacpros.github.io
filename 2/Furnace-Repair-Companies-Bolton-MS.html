<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However a number of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne impurities in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
