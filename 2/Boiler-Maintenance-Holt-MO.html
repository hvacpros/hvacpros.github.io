<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same.
