<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
