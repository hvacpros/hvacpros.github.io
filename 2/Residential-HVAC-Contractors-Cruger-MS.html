<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
