A ductless unit has an integrated effectiveness advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy.
