Usage fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to make sure the fans run for a sufficient period of time. A great rule of thumb is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
