<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services should still be readily available for your home's systems.

<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
