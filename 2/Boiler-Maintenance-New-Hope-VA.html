<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having fixed the issue with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, simple and a completely pleasurable individual to have around that whole time. His time and competence to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
