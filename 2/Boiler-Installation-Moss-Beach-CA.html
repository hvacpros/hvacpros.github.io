<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Moss Beach CA</h3>
<p>The reality is, air contamination in your home can be just as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American spending 87% of their life inside, you 'd believe that indoor air quality would be something we 'd become aware of more often. But do not worry! With a little preventative maintenance and some basic understanding, you can take immediate actions to improve your indoor air quality today.<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types. Gas heaters cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
