<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Wilmette IL</h3>
<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. You'll have a water leak if your HVAC unit is not draining effectively. A limitation in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are several places an obstruction can occur. One of the primary areas where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
