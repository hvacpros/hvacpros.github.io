<h3>Ductless AC System in Bradley IL</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
