Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to perform the essential electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
