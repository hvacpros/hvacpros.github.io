<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Midwest</h2>

It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
