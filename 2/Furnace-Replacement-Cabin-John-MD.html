<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
