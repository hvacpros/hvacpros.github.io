<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in Naval Air Station Jrb TX</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
