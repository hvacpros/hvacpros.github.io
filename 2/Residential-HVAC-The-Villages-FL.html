<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite considerable.<p>
