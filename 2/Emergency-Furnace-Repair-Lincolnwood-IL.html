<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
