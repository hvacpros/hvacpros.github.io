<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house.

An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
