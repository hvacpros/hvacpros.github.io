<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
