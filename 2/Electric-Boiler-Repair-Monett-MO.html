<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Monett MO HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
