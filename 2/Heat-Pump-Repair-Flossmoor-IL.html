<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem.

The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
