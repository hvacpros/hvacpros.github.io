<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
