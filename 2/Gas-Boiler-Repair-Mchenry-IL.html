<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
