<p>There is no easy answer, however many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better solution. If the existing system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
