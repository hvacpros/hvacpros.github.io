<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Company in Calabasas</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
