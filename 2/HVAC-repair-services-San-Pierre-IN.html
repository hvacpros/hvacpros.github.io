<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers pollutants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the producer's instructions.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
