<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of workers in the location, stagnant air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Mentioning air, radiant heat systems tend to enhance indoor air quality. This is because required air heating systems circulate airborne pollutants throughout the house during operation, provoking a variety of various unfavorable effects. Radiant heating systems don't distribute air at all, which actually enhances your indoor air quality by restricting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne pollutants.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Berkley MA</h3>
<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas before we offer advice to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of health issue caused by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and gastrointestinal problems.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
