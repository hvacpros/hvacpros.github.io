<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
