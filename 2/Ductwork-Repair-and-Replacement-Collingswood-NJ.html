<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Collingswood NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
