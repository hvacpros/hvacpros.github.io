<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
