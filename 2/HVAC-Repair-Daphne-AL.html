<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11.

They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

<p>The primary factor homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost might not be beneficial. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's service warranty.

A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of recurring use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature degeneration, causing holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
