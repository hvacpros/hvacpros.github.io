<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

You might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and performance if you already have a house heating system. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
