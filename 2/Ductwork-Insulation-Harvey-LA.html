<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Harvey LA</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is normally used in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
