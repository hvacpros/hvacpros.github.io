Taylor took adequate time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the needed electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
