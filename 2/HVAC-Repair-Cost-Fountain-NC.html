<p>It can be the ideal time to brainstorm imaginative techniques for promoting your HVAC company as well when business is less hectic. For instance, you might attempt participating in home and garden programs, trade shows or other type of occasion marketing. Or perhaps you'll present a contest, a free gift or a special funding plan to boost equipment sales. You can formalize them as part of the marketing technique you lay out in next year's company plan if the experiments pay off.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
