<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor.

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the company have air monitoring tests carried out. Review of this information might recognize possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
