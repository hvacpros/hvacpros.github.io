He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly pleasurable person to have around that entire time. His time and know-how to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat uncertain diagnostic.<p>
<p>I have actually used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have signed an annual maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has been fantastic through all these years.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.
