<h3>Methods to Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Fulton CA</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the various houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile homes, homes, high-rise condos, row housing, and so on). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, adequate air circulation (ventilation), appropriate purification, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is operating securely and not contributing to or triggering an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
