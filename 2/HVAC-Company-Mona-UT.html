<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
