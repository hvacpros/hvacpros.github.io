Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion procedure. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a fairly simple procedure. If you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>

<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
