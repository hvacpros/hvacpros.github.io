<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
