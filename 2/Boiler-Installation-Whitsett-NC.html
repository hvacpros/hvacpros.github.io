<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Whitsett NC</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them once again.<p>
<p>Most people don't realize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break with time.

<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Whitsett NC HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
