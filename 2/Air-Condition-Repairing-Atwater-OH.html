<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
