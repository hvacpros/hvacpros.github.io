<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
