<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
