<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in Roscoe MO?</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
