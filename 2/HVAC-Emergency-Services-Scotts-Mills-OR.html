<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
