<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>A split a/c includes 2 primary parts - a compressor located outside and an inside air outlet system. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, divided a/c depend on a set of pipes to link the outside to the inside air system which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split a/c installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipes that cycle through the system to produce either cold or heated air.<p>
