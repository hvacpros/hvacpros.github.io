<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
