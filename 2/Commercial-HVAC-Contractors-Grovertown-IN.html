<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
