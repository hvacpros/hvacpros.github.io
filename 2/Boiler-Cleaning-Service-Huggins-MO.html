From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system.

<p>In addition to getting the big image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to provide threshold informs. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
