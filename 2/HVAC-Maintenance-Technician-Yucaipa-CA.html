<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is often vital to determining the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Review of this information might determine potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, monitoring information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
