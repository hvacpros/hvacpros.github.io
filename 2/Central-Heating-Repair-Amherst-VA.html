<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall.

<h3>Repair and Care for Amherst VA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
