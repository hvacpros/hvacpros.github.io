<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who reside in the home.

Germs and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building occupants may be exposed to a variety of pollutants (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning items, construction activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outside pollutants.
