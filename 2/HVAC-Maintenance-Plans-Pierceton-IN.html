<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are ending up being common features of environment-friendly houses as part of the growing green structure motion.

By 2016, a Wall Street Journal post anticipated that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>
