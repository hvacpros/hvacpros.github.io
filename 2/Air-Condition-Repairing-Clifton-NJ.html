<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
