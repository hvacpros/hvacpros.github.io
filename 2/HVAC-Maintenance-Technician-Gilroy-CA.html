<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
