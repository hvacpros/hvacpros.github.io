This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house.

Due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize system does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
