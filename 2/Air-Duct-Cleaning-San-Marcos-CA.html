<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace in San Marcos CA?</h3>
<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological contaminants are moist or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents.

<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the technicians believed they simply didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
