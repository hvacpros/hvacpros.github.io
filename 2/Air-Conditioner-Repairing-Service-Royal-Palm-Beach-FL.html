Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope.

Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
