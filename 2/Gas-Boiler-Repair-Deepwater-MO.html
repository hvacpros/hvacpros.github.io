<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have an expert technician inspect the system occasionally.<p>
