Load determining is described as the Handbook J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based upon BTUs, identifying the proper size of unit for your house also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>

Forced air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Forced air heating systems likewise tend to produce cold and hot spots throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>
