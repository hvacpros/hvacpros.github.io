Among the main locations where clogs start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
