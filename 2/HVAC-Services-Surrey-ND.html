<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Surrey ND Home</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
