The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously.

The sound level is low and itâ $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
