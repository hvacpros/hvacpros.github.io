<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
