<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
