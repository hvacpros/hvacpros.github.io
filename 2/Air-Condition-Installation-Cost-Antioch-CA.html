<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
