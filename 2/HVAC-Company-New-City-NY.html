<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
