Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
