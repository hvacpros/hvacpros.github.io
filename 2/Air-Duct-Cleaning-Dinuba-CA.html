<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this fundamental guideline when deciding whether it's worth purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, as well as all other kinds of heat pumps, have efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP.

This indicates for every single unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 units are provided as heat.<p>
