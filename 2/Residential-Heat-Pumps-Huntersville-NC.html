<p>As a skilled HVAC specialist, we advise you have your systems examined and routine maintenance performed two times annually, when in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and as soon as in the Fall (before heating season).

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Huntersville NC</h3>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can go a long way towards decreasing many of the concerns caused by build-up of dirt and debris, and the inspections allow your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term concerns and take proactive actions to assist prevent premature failure or troublesome breakdowns throughout the heating season. Annual furnace service might also be a requirement to keep your furnace guarantee legitimate also. Numerous producers state on guarantee documents that installation and maintenance by a certified HVAC service provider belong of the service warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts minimal guarantee as is basic on Carrier ® furnaces, you'll wish to be sure you keep that coverage valid for the complete ten years.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
