<p>There are a few possibilities to explain brief cycling in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the very low temperature levels.

There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. Contact among our service technicians if you require clearness on this problem.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, people breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not poisonous, however might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are permitted to collect. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they may spread throughout the entire work environment or structure by ways of the ventilation system.<p>
