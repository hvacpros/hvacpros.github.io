<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might wish to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capabilities. If you already have a home heating system, you might search for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
