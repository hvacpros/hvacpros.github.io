<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, below the wooded subsurface and last flooring surface. This is typically used in a third-floor or 2nd area and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the whole surface of a flooring heats the lower half of the room, enveloping residents in heat at a lower overall temperature-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater." In other words, in-floor heating systems supply a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
