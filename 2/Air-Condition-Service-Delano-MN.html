<p>A lot of well and city water does not generally contain lead. Water usually gets lead inside the house from home plumbing that is made with lead products.

This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
