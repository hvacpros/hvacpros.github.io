<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
