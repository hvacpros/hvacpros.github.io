<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Spanish Fort AL</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release toxins basically continuously. Other sources, associated to activities performed in the house, release contaminants periodically. These include smoking, the use of unvented or malfunction-ing ranges, furnaces, or area heating units, the use of solvents in cleaning and pastime activities, making use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and making use of cleaning items and pesticides in house cleaning. High pollutant concentrations can stay in the air for long periods after some of these activities.<p>
