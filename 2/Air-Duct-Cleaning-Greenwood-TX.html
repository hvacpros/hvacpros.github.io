<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a contemporary furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% efficiency, this can indicate considerable savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the really core of the furnace. Changing one indicates disassembling most of the furnace, replacing the part, and reassembling the furnace. The number of hours it takes typically triggers the repair to be more expensive than the furnace was or a new one would be. If you replace a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, consider anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin since they have the very best heat exchanger guarantees in the market on their top heaters.<p>
