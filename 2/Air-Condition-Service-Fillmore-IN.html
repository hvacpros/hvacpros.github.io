All of the latest heaters are a lot more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years earlier.

<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we offer suggestions to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
