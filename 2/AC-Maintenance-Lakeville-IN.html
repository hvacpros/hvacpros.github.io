<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system.

Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space.

Throughout the assessment on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision.
