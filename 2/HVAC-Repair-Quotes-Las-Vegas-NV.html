<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.

<p>These men have been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to offer me an opinion for what deal with a home might cost. Recently I needed to contact these guys two times.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>While contaminants commonly found in indoor air are responsible for numerous damaging results, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce specific illness. People likewise react extremely in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air contaminants. More research is needed to much better understand which health effects occur after direct exposure to the average toxin concentrations discovered in homes and which happen from the higher concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in place.

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
