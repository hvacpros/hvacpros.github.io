To conserve energy and cash, you need to shop an energy-efficient air conditioning system and minimize your central air conditioner's energy usage.

In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
