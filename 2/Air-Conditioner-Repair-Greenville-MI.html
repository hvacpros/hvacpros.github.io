<p>Immediate effects may appear after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant effects are usually short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely getting rid of the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to control than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
