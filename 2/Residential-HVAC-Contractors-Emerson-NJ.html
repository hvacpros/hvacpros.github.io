<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
