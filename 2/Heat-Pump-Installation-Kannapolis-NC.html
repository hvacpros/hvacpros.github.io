This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

In many cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
