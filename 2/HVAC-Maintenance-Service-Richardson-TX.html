<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

<p>The most common type of house heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey choice, but newer systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, extremely effective natural gas furnaces can accomplish AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
