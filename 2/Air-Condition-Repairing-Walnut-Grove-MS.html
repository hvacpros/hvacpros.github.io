<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently may be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, specifically in commercial buildings, apartment and very large houses. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
