<p>Given that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they manufacture more effective. This was initially driven by rising energy costs, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns.

Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
