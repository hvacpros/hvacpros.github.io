<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
