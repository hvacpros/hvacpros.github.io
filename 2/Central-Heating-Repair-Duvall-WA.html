<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
