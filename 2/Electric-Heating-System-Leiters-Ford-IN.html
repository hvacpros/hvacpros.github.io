He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a long period of time.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
