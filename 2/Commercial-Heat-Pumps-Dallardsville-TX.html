<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to provide car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
