For example, we might see a window as altering slightly in time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life.

Since an unit is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
