<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up routinely, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases cause the system to close down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and checking filter can usually be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
