<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
