<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
