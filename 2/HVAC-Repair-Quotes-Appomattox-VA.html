<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
