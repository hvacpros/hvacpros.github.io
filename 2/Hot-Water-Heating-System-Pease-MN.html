It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
