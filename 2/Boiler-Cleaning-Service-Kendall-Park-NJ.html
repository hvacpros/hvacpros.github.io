<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
