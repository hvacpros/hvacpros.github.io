Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
