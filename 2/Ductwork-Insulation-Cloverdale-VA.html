<h3>Furnace Company in Cloverdale VA</h3>
<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in damp air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
