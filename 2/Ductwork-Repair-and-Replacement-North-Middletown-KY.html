<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
