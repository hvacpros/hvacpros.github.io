Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely.
