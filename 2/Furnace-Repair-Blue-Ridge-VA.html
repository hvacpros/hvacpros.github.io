<h3>Things Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Blue Ridge VA HVAC Companies</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating unit.<p>
