<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same.

Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
