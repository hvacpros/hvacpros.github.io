<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
