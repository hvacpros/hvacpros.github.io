<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally taking place chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; floor, wall and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances).
