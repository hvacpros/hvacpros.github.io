<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
