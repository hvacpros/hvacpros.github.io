Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
