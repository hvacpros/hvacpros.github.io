This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
