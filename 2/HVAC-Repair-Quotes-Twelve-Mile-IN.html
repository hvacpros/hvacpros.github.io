Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
