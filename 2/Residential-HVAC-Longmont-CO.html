<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
