<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators used flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
