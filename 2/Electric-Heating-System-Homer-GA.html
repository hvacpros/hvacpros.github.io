All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the problem. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
