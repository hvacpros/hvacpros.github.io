<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
