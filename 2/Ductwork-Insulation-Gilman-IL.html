<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts suggest following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
